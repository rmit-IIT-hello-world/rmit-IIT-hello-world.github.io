					<h2>What does it do?</h2>
					<p>Cybersecurity has been an indispensable technology since the birth of the internet when it comes
						to protecting people. If there is no cybersecurity there will be all kinds of criminal
						intimidation in the internet world and people will be vulnerable to hackers. However,
						cybersecurity has developed rapidly in the past two decades. This is not only because of the
						maturity of Internet technology, but also because of the continuous improvement of Internet
						facilities. Therefore, its rapid development depends on the fast progression of social science
						and technology. Today's rapid development of science and technology cannot happen without the
						leap of Internet technology. With the development of Internet technology, people pay more
						attention to the development of cybersecurity because people have always been like this, hoping
						that their environment is safe and reliable. Maintaining cybersecurity in a constantly evolving
						threat landscape is a challenge for all organizations (Searchsecurity 2021). Therefore, people
						want to develop cybersecurity technology, and this is also in line with the order of social
						development. </p>
					<p>Cybersecurity is also applied to social media, national protection and property security. Now
						cybersecurity can not only maintain the normal order of the Internet. It can also accelerate the
						protection of various industrial chains by the Internet. For example, cybersecurity protects the
						confidential documents of the state in order to ensure that the security of state property is
						not threatened by foreign illegal forces. Also, cybersecurity is protecting the personal privacy
						of every mobile phone user in order to ensure that the user's privacy and property will not be
						disclosed. Next, cybersecurity also protects the intellectual property rights and intellectual
						property rights of the masses and companies. Some books and copyrighted film and television
						resources are protected by cybersecurity. In addition, cybersecurity can deny spyware because
						spyware is a form of cyber infection which is designed to spy on your computer actions and relay
						that information back to the cyber-criminal. A great cyber security solution, such as Fortinet’s
						FortiGate firewall, can prevent this spyware from taking effect and ensure that your employees’
						actions remain private and confidential within your workplace (Nouveau Solutions 2016).
						Moreover, cybersecurity can protect productivity because viruses can slow down personal
						computers to a crawl, and make working on them practically impossible. This can cause a lot of
						wasted time for your employees, and can often bring your entire business to a standstill
						(Nouveau Solutions 2016). </p>
					<p>Finally, cybersecurity can also protect the national military defense forces from infringement,
						prevent spies and hackers from invading the national defense forces, and avoid network collapse.
						So as to stabilize homeland security and people's security. </p>
					<p>
						In the next three years, our cybersecurity will face great challenges. With the continuous
						progress of science and technology, people's level of education is increasing and all kinds of
						sophisticated computer talents are constantly introduced by the state. Therefore, breaking
						through the network defense line is the only way in the future war. In the future, cybersecurity
						is the top priority of national defense forces and in today's modern world, destroying a
						country's cybersecurity can destroy a country's network system. If a country does not have a
						network system, all the battle commands will be almost paralyzed in this country. Moreover, in
						the future, every entity merchant also needs the protection of cybersecurity. This is because in
						the future Internet physical stores, all currencies and membership cards used for payment may be
						electronic virtual. Cybersecurity is to help these merchants solve the problem of property
						security. Finally, we can achieve national peace and security, and people can live in the
						network environment at ease.
					</p>
					<p>I think advanced 5G technology can make it possible. Super high network speed can break through
						the enemy's network defense at a critical moment. I also think the development of supercomputers
						can help cybersecurity to another level. It is precisely because of the fast network speed and
						computer processing speed that encryption and decryption become particularly easy. People's
						sense of security should come from cybersecurity. In short, I believe that the continuous
						improvement of science and technology will accelerate the rapid development of t of
						cybersecurity. I hope it can help people solve the difficulties of the information networking
						era and provide basic security for people. </p>
					<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
					<p>This development will bring a high sense of security to my life. I will feel that I will not
						receive any fear of criminal threat in the online environment. On the contrary, I would think
						that such an online world is a harmonious, stable world. The development of cybersecurity will
						bring stability and prosperity to the country. So that the country can develop stably and
						harmoniously and avoid the outbreak of war. It can effectively prevent the bad intentions of
						other countries and enhance the strength of our country. Both scientific and technological
						strength and economic strength will be effectively guaranteed. The continuous growth of
						cybersecurity positively reflects the continuous strength of the country. People will also
						realize economic freedom, trade freedom and network freedom under the Internet economic system.
						When dealing with network problems, enterprises or countries do not have to worry too much about
						being invaded by hackers and data leakage. Moreover, the trust between people on the Internet is
						also changing. People will be more friendly and harmonious. </p>
					<p>Information theft is the most expensive and fastest-growing segment of cybercrime. Largely driven
						by the increasing exposure of identity information to the web via cloud services (Upguard 2021).
						I think in the country, the people who take hacker as their profession and do some illegal and
						criminal activities are the most affected. This is because of the improvement of cybersecurity.
						It makes it impossible for them to easily invade the employer's network. Finally, we face the
						risk of unemployment. Therefore, such a career will indeed be greatly affected. Their profession
						itself is a hacker prohibited by law. The end result is that they should be replaced. Therefore,
						the potential impact of cyber security is to make society a better place. So that the illegal
						personnel become gradually scarce. We will make society harmonious and stable and let people
						live and work in peace and contentment. Let justice come quickly, and let injustice be far away
						from people. </p>

					<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
					<p>In my daily life, I always use the convenience brought by the Internet. But in the earliest
						Internet age. Cybersecurity has not been effectively protected. So many times, I worry that the
						balance in my online account will become less. I'm afraid of being stolen by hackers. Nowadays,
						cybersecurity has been greatly improved. It not only makes me have great confidence in the
						security of online shopping. It also makes me really realize that cybersecurity has become an
						indispensable part of my daily life. I will choose the Internet for social communication. And I
						will use the Internet to pay my bills. While carrying out these processes, I never worried that
						hackers or other things would threaten me. Maybe this is the sense of security brought by
						cybersecurity. I also use the computer to encrypt some of my files. Although the encryption
						process is very simple, because it is one key encryption. But the whole encryption algorithm is
						very difficult to crack. This is the change brought to us by the Internet. My friends and family
						also realize the convenience brought by the Internet. They usually shop on the Internet. Will
						also use the cash consumption of the network. And most importantly, they have never worried that
						their private data will be leaked by the Internet. These are the self-confidence and influence
						brought by cybersecurity in recent years. Therefore, my family and friends and I are very proud
						of the current level of cybersecurity. At the same time, we are also looking forward to what the
						future of cybersecurity will look like? What impact will it have on our lives? These are what we
						expect. We expect it to be stronger and stronger, and it will protect us better and better. This
						is precisely the impact of cybersecurity has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.
