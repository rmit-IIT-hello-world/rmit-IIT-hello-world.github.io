						<h1>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>What does it do?</h2>
					<p>When we mention cryptocurrency, we first think of bitcoin and blockchain, as the underlying
						technology of bitcoin, is gradually understood by everyone. Cryptocurrency will drive the
						development of blockchain and provide an incentive mechanism, and its value also represents the
						value of blockchain. Blockchain technology can be considered as an accounting method and a form
						of database preservation. Blockchain technology essentially eliminates third-party institutions.
						Blockchain is a data structure (stack and queue are also data structures). </p>
					<p>When we mention cryptocurrency, we first think of bitcoin and blockchain, as the underlying
						technology of bitcoin, is gradually understood by everyone. Cryptocurrency will drive the
						development of blockchain and provide an incentive mechanism, and its value also represents the
						value of blockchain. Blockchain technology can be considered as an accounting method and a form
						of database preservation. Blockchain technology essentially eliminates third-party institutions.
						Blockchain is a data structure (stack and queue are also data structures). </p>
					<p>Since it is a data structure, the role of blockchain is to organize and store data. Bitcoin is a
						digital currency made by using this technology. With the whole cryptocurrency market hitting a
						record high, from "tax-free passport" to "high-value assets", various applications of blockchain
						have attracted people's attention again. We expect to see more application of blockchain
						technology in supply chain and sustainable procurement, especially in the mining and metal
						industries. From finance to cloud storage, the demand for more decentralized infrastructure may
						increase. COVID-19 also pushed forward the exploration of the technology of blockchain by the
						central bank's digital currency. More countries began to try to use digital currency under the
						influence of the epidemic. For example, China continued to push forward DCEP (digital currency /
						electronic payment). The Chinese people's Bank of China has completed a pilot project in
						Shenzhen, Xiong An and Suzhou, and handled 1 billion 100 million yuan in 3 million 100 thousand
						transactions (Boxmining 2021) . </p>
					<p>However, with the development of cryptocurrency technology, blockchain technology supporting the
						cryptocurrency is gradually attracting attention. For example, inaccurate information of airport
						inbound passengers is usually the main reason for virus transmission, because it is difficult
						for the airport to track and verify all transfer information and the number of passengers per
						passenger.

					</p>
					<p>However, the distributed blockchain system can meet these challenges through its consistency and
						reliability. An a-CDM airport management system uses blockchain technology (2021) Maybe within
						three years from abroad, blockchain technology can be applied to various fields, such as medical
						and health education. Because of the unique decentralization of blockchain, there is no
						intermediary between users to obtain benefits, faster, and more direct communication. </p>
					<p>In addition, blockchain can be understood as a technical scheme for public accounting. The system
						is completely open and transparent. The account books are open to everyone to realize data
						sharing, and anyone can check the accounts. </p>
					<p>At the same time, the blockchain also has irrevocable, tamper proof and encryption security,
						because the blockchain adopts a one-way hash algorithm and each newly generated block advances
						in strict chronological order. The irreversibility and irreversibility of time make any attempt
						to invade and tamper with the data information in the blockchain easy to be traced, resulting in
						exclusion by other nodes and high counterfeiting cost, Thus, the relevant wrongful acts can be
						limited. Cryptocurrency may become the digital currency used by people in large transactions.
						The impact of the epidemic on countries around the world will make these situations possible.
					</p>
					<p>At the same time, the performance improvement of computer hardware makes every individual able to
						participate in cryptocurrency transactions and join the blockchain network. In addition,
						people's understanding of cryptocurrency is also changing, and more and more people understand
						the benefits of cryptocurrency and blockchain systems, Therefore, these conditions will affect
						the development of blockchain systems.

					</p>

					<p>There are many promising projects in the blockchain field. We don't know what is waiting for us,
						just as we couldn't predict what will happen tomorrow. Decentralization, bitcoin,
						cryptocurrency, and blockchain innovation are a movement of inclusion, sharing, learning, and
						open-source development. If developed well, the movement will not bring the next large pyramid
						grading system that is controlled and opaque. This will bring an incredible wave of innovation,
						unprecedented financial rights, and new ways of exchange and storage value. It will be highly
						subversive.

					</p>
					<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
					<p>Blockchain not only has an impact on finance and the Internet of things but also may play a role
						in civil life, including economic inclusion and prosperity around the world. In many parts of
						the world, people's wealth is stored in items such as livestock or land, rather than traditional
						financial instruments or institutions. By using blockchain technology and blockchain-based
						currency, a person's identity becomes a digital identity because some of their wealth is stored
						in assets linked to the blockchain. In doing so, they suddenly have access to services they
						could not access before. In turn, banks and other financial institutions are more interested in
						transactions with them and may provide loans to them because they clearly understand who this
						person is and how their financial situation is. At the same time, another increasingly
						widespread use of blockchain is information storage and control. </p>
					<p>Today, our personal information (search history, medical records, fitness tracking data) is
						controlled and monetized by third parties. If our personal information is stored on the
						blockchain and connected to our digital identity, we will control who can access it. This will
						enable individuals to sell or lease their information and gain value in return. At the same
						time, such a system also provides a more secure defense against identity theft without
						third-party monitoring. Blockchain is security and monitor. Blockchain will change the world of
						Finance and personal security. With the surge of data generated through the Internet of things
						and networking devices, and micro transmission has increasingly become a reality in daily life,
						blockchain will become the basic component of the whole new world of digital interaction and
						trading. </p>

					<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
					<p>My friend invited me to trade cryptocurrency together, and I also tried it through my mobile
						phone. However, due to the immature technology, cryptocurrency has no great impact on my daily
						life for people who have no capital level. In ordinary transactions, the traditional currency is
						used as usual, and it will not affect my family, perhaps cryptocurrency can better affect the
						country or people with certain financial capacity. </p>
					<p>For my friend, it obtains a small amount of money by buying and selling bitcoin, but it has no
						great impact on his life. The application of blockchain systems in all aspects of life, such as
						airport, medical and health care, can make my life and my family more convenient. Blockchain can
						establish digital proof that cannot be tampered with. New authentication mechanisms can be
						established in the fields of digital copyright, intellectual property, certificates, and public
						welfare to improve the management level of public services. </p>
					<p>The medical industry has begun to adopt blockchain technology in various aspects, such as
						protecting the privacy of medical records and ensuring the integrity of medical data (such as
						MRI results) sent over the Internet. At the same time, another social change brought about by
						blockchain is the arrival of the era of the real sharing economy. People are looking forward to
						the era of direct transaction and sharing based on trust. If a person has competitive data, it
						can be shared on the blockchain platform without passing through a third-party organization.
