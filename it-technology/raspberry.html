					<h2>Small computing device functions </h2>
					<p>Small computing device have the most of the characteristics of computers but are in small size, small computing devices are usually used as mid-range servers and small computing device many functions and can develop software or run medium-sized software.(jack Schofield 2019) Compared with conventional computing devices, small computing devices are very convenient to carry and can help people easily program. There are very important functions in programming education and some development functions, such as Raspberry Pi, which can be programmed well by plugging in the keyboard, such as popular python, C java, etc. Open source software Linux can use Raspberry Pi to build web server and file sharing server. At the same time, a lot of technological DIY allows Raspberry Pi to do many control-based projects, such as automatic cat feeding machines, etc., which need to be used with circuits. As an open source software for programming education, arduino is very popular in the market. The arduino IDE uses a simplified version of the C++ language to make it easier to learn programming. (B_E_N,time unknown) makey makeys as a keyboard auxiliary tool, as a tool, it can link some devices well. After the circuit is connected, it can achieve the effect of controlling the computer. For example, MIT students use bananas as keyboards.(Naveena Kottoor 2012) In general, the types of small computing systems are very complex and have different functions. Arduino as a microcontroller, by entering loop codes, is very suitable for simple and repetitive tasks, while the Raspberry Pi is very powerful and can run the Linux operating system completely. It can be used as a small computer, which is very convenient.  

Regarding some of the latest technologies in small computing software such as Raspberry Pi, regarding the use of Raspberry Pi to make a remote-controlled tank, (Clare Hoppingthe 2021) center of the Raspberry Pi 4 can be equipped with a motor driver called Raspberry Pi Zero, which can be used with Xbox controller is compatible, Raspberry Pi 4 can be equipped with different thermal imagers and cameras. The latest version of Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi Pico released by the Planning Commission in 2021, Pico has designed a unique chip internally instead of using a ready-made chip. The unique packaging is soldered on the plug pins to make it suitable for PCB or standard non-standard chips. Weld the prototype test board. There is no plug pin, so it is suitable for surface mounting, and some new commercial value. Pico only costs $4. It has some superficial shortcomings like no WiFi, not enough RAM and storage space, but it is welcomed because of its high cost performance.(Gerald 2020) Regarding the latest technology of Raspberry Pi, Oracle tried to build a supercomputer with 1,060 Raspberry Pis. Although this cluster project was not built for functions, fresh attempts can try to develop more functions about Raspberry Pi.  Such as large-scale technology DIY and so on. . .（ Ash Puckett 2019） Regarding recent trends, Google has focused more on software rather than hardware. Perhaps blindly pursuing hardware upgrades is not the current mainstream. I believe that small computing devices will also be more researched on software development or compatibility. More functions of the Raspberry Pi have been developed, because from the first generation of the Raspberry Pi to the current fourth generation, the hardware functions have been upgraded, and now the hardware functions are powerful enough and even overcapacity. </p>
					<h2>Impact on people</h2>
					<p>With the beginning of industrial automation, many jobs may be replaced by intelligence, just as traditional agricultural irrigation is gradually replaced by automated irrigation technology, many jobs, such as services, will disappear. Now, the simplest arduino can be used to make sweeping robots, automatic cat feeding machines, automatic irrigation machines, etc. While enjoying the convenience of technology, people may also lose their jobs and employment opportunities. High-tech computing devices can realize automatic driving. Autonomous driving technology is becoming popular in big cities. 

The development of small computing equipment will facilitate our lives. For example, many kinds of automation devices created by small computers, etc. When the setup and loop code are established, these automation devices can run, which will facilitate our lives. At the same time, it will be based on small computing devices. The most basic facilities such as the switch of LEDs can allow people to easily control the operation and shutdown of some specific machines. Small computing devices can also be educational programming. The installation of display screens can be used as monitor etc., so that people do not need to use additional of the funds to buy a monitor. 
					</p>
					<h2>impact on me</h2>
					<p>I can try to use Raspberry Pi, arduino and other small computing software to make some technological DIY, or invent some software, etc., just like the game of Pac-Man, it can help people deeply understand the operation principle of small computing equipment in network security, technology DIY can cultivate an interest in IT very well. It can get rid of my dependence on some technological products like cameras. You can use Raspberry Pi to create a camera instead of buying it, which can save money and so on. . This will have an impact on my family and friends. I can discuss this knowledge with my friends, and when I have doubts about the programs and circuits I have written, maybe I can ask my family or friends to solve this problem. I have some friends who are very interested in computers. Small computing devices are a very good operable hardware. People can connect various devices to achieve the required functions, and they can also consolidate themselves by learning programming on small computing devices. My friends and family members like small programming devices very much. 

In my opinion, small computing devices are very different from regular computing devices. I think small computing devices are very flexible. For example, the Raspberry Pi can be turned into a small computer and used while walking. For people at work, This will be a good office tool. Conventional computing devices are more useful in more cases, but there are many ways to develop small computing devices and they are very flexible. This is really very different. I love small computing devices, because different devices have different functions. I can buy them according to my needs. I can buy a Raspberry Pi with strong performance. I can choose to have less performance but very cheap. It is very friendly to novices. Arduino. . . </p>
