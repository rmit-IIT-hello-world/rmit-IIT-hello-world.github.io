						<h1>Small computing device</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>What does it do?</h2>
					<p>Small computing devices have most of the characteristics of computers but are small size, small
						computing devices are usually used as mid-range servers, and small computing devices have many
						functions and can develop software or run medium-sized software (jack Schofield 2019). Compared
						with conventional computing devices, small computing devices are very convenient to carry and
						can help people easily program. There are very important functions in programming education and
						some development functions, such as Raspberry Pi, which can be programmed well by plugging in
						the keyboard, such as popular python, C java, etc. Open-source software Linux can use Raspberry
						Pi to build web servers and file-sharing servers. </p>
					<p>At the same time, a lot of technological DIY allows Raspberry Pi to do many control-based
						projects, such as automatic cat feeding machines, etc., which need to be used with circuits. As
						an open-source software for programming education, Arduino is very popular in the market. The
						Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of the C++ language to make it easier to learn programming
						(B_E_N 2021). Makey Makeys as a keyboard auxiliary tool, as a tool, it can link some devices
						well. After the circuit is connected, it can achieve the effect of controlling the computer. For
						example, MIT students use bananas as keyboards (Naveena Kottoor 2012). In general, the types of
						small computing systems are very complex and have different functions. Arduino as a
						microcontroller, by entering loop codes, is very suitable for simple and repetitive tasks, while
						the Raspberry Pi is very powerful and can run the Linux operating system completely. It can be
						used as a small computer, which is very convenient. </p>
					<p>Regarding some of the latest technologies in small computing software such as Raspberry Pi,
						regarding the use of Raspberry Pi to make a remote-controlled tank, center of the Raspberry Pi 4
						can be equipped with a motor driver called Raspberry Pi Zero, which can be used with Xbox
						controller is compatible, Raspberry Pi 4 can be equipped with different thermal imagers and
						cameras (Clare Hopping 2021). </p>
					<p>The latest version of Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi Pico released by the Planning Commission in
						2021, Pico has designed a unique chip internally instead of using a ready-made chip. The unique
						packaging is soldered on the plug pins to make it suitable for PCB or standard non-standard
						chips. Weld the prototype test board. There is no plug pin, so it is suitable for surface
						mounting, and some new commercial value. Pico only costs $4. It has some superficial
						shortcomings like no WIFI, not enough RAM and storage space, but it is welcomed because of its
						high-cost performance (Gerald Venzl 2020). Regarding the latest technology of Raspberry Pi,
						Oracle tried to build a supercomputer with 1,060 Raspberry Pis. Although this cluster project
						was not built for functions, fresh attempts can try to develop more functions about Raspberry
						Pi. </p>
					<p>Regarding recent trends, Google has focused more on software rather than hardware. Perhaps
						blindly pursuing hardware upgrades is not the current mainstream. I believe that small computing
						devices will also be more researched on software development or compatibility. More functions of
						the Raspberry Pi have been developed, because from the first generation of the Raspberry Pi to
						the current fourth generation, the hardware functions have been upgraded, and now the hardware
						functions are powerful enough and even overcapacity. </p>
					<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
					<p>With the beginning of industrial automation, many jobs may be replaced by intelligence, just as
						traditional agricultural irrigation is gradually replaced by automated irrigation technology,
						many jobs, such as services, will disappear. Now, the simplest Arduino can be used to make
						sweeping robots, automatic cat feeding machines, automatic irrigation machines, etc. While
						enjoying the convenience of technology, people may also lose their jobs and employment
						opportunities. High-tech computing devices can realize automatic driving. Autonomous driving
						technology is becoming popular in big cities.

					</p>
					<p>The development of small computing equipment will facilitate our lives. For example, many kinds
						of automation devices created by small computers, etc. When the setup and loop code are
						established, these automation devices can run, which will facilitate our lives. At the same
						time, it will be based on small computing devices. The most basic facilities such as the switch
						of LEDs can allow people to easily control the operation and shutdown of some specific machines.
						Small computing devices can also be educational programming. The installation of display screens
						can be used as monitor etc., so that people do not need to use additional of the funds to buy a
						monitor. </p>
					<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
					<p>I can try to use Raspberry Pi, Arduino and other small computing software to make some
						technological DIY, or invent some software, etc., just like the game of Pac-Man, it can help
						people deeply understand the operation principle of small computing equipment in network
						security, technology DIY can cultivate an interest in IT very well. It can get rid of my
						dependence on some technological products like cameras. You can use Raspberry Pi to create a
						camera instead of buying it, which can save money and so on. This will have an impact on my
						family and friends. I can discuss this knowledge with my friends, and when I have doubts about
						the programs and circuits I have written, maybe I can ask my family or friends to solve this
						problem. I have some friends who are very interested in computers. Small computing devices are
						very good operable hardware. People can connect various devices to achieve the required
						functions, and they can also consolidate themselves by learning programming on small computing
						devices. My friends and family members like small programming devices very much. </p>
					<p>In my opinion, small computing devices are very different from regular computing devices. I think
						small computing devices are very flexible. For example, the Raspberry Pi can be turned into a
						small computer and used while walking. For people at work, this will be a good office tool.
						Conventional computing devices are more useful in more cases, but there are many ways to develop
						small computing devices and they are very flexible. This is really very different. I love small
						computing devices, because different devices have different functions. I can buy them according
						to my needs. I can buy a Raspberry Pi with strong performance. I can choose to have less
						performance but very cheap. It is very friendly to novices. Arduino. </p>
