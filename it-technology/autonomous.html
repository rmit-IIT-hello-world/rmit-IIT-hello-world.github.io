						<h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>What does it do?</h2>
					<p>
						Autonomous vehicles are self-driving vehicles that are controlled by an AI program within the
						cars.

						Autonomous vehicles are also known as driverless cars because they do not require a driver in a
						driverless car.
					</p>
					<p>The current year is 2021. Most advanced autonomous vehicles can reach level 3 of SAE(Society of
						Automotive Engineers). SAE, standing for the Society of Automotive Engineers, determines the
						intelligence level and automation capabilities of vehicles, ranking through 0 to 5. Level 0 is
						No Automation. Level 1 is Driver Assistance. Level 2 is Partial Automation. Level 2+ is Advanced
						Partial Automation. Level 3 is Conditional Automation. Level 4 is High Automation. Level 5 is
						Full Automation (Wikipedia 2021). At level 3, cars are not required to take control, but only in
						specific situations. Conditions can be road types, traffic conditions and weather conditions.
						Because drivers can focus on other tasks including watching films or reading newspapers this
						level of automation is considered the initial entry point into autonomous driving. However,
						drivers still need to take over when the system requests it. For example, autopilots in Tesla
						allow drivers to relax in a traffic jam or on a highway and the system will control
						acceleration, steering and braking. Drivers still need to monitor the car’s state and prepare to
						take over the car. There are a number of sensors in an autonomous car, including anti-lock
						braking systems, active steering, GPS navigation technology, adaptive cruise control lasers and
						radars. These components support the current autonomous driving technologies. </p>
					<p>In the future, it is likely to achieve level 4 which is high automation and there is no need for
						the driver at most times, but it might be needing the driver at some point. Autonomous cars in
						level 4 are not required drivers who need to monitor cars’ status all the time. The system will
						decide whether the driver needs to take over the car or not. In level 4, drivers may safely go
						to sleep and watch films. However, self-driving in level 4 is supported only in limited areas
						such as highways or some cities. Once self-driving cars leave certain areas, the car will stop
						and request driver’s control. Therefore, autonomous taxis and autonomous tracks would be
						important applications in level 4 as Taxis and tracks always work in a limited number of areas.
					</p>
					<p>There are a number of technologies to achieve autonomous driving. The most important one is deep
						learning. Deep learning is one kind of machine learning. </p>
					<h3>Computer vision </h3>
					<p>Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to get
						meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs and make
						recommendations based on that information. In self-driving, computer vision can help cars
						identify moving objects and make driving decisions. </p>
					<h3>Deep learning</h3>
					<p>Deep learning is one kind of machine learning algorithm that uses multiple layers to
						progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. The system will use deep
						learning to train a proper driving model with the huge amount of data generated while driving.
						The system can get driving decisions based on the training model. </p>
					<h3>Laser radar</h3>
					<p>Laser radar is a method for deriving distance by targeting an object with a laser and measuring
						the time for the reflected light to return to the receiver. Laser radars can detect the distance
						of surrounding vehicles. For example, Xpeng P5 has 2 powerful lidars to improve the detection of
						moving objects. The system can handle the input of lidars and calculate the object’s distance,
						direction, speed, altitude and so on. </p>

					<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
					<p>The potential impact of autonomous cars includes reducing car accident rates, decreasing the
						number of professional drivers and reducing the use of petroleum fuels. When there will be a
						large number of fully autonomous vehicles on the road, the chances of accidents will be
						decreased strongly because most of the accidents are due to human errors. It will likely make
						our roads much safer and reduce traffic congestions. </p>
					<p>Professional drivers will be most likely to be affected by autonomous vehicles. If cars can be
						driven without any artificial control, taxi companies and trucking companies will not hire many
						professional drivers. They may lose their jobs. However, the question is whether the traffic law
						allows cars that do not require any driver. Only one incident can make the public doubt the
						safety of autonomous driving. For example, the death of Elaine Herzberg was the first recorded
						case of a pedestrian fatality involving a Uber self-driving car on the evening of March 18,
						2018. Then, Uber stopped all self-driving tests under public pressure and sold its autonomous
						vehicle research division to a startup named Aurora in 2020. </p>
					<p>Most autonomous vehicles are electric vehicles. The promotion of electric vehicles can decrease
						the usage of fossil fuels and abate pollution. More EV(electric vehicle) charging stations will
						replace gas stations. Electric vehicles usually can have a higher speed compared to traditional
						cars. </p>
					<p>The traffic ticket due to humans’ mistakes on roads or with vehicles is important revenue for the
						governments to collect money. As only one parking fine costs more than $70, railway crossing on
						a red light or when the light is blinking can cost up to $750 and there are heaps of fines. The
						government will have to come up with new traffic rules and regulations. </p>

					<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
					<p>If autonomous vehicles hit the automobile markets, the things it might change for me can be the
						cost of daily transport, time and car insurance and roadside assistance. I do not have to wait
						for public transport every morning and I can call a cheap autonomous taxi without a driver.
						Moreover, AI technology will greatly reduce the probability of accidents. Autonomous vehicle
						systems can know everything around the car and avoid danger. </p>
					<p>Autonomous vehicles might strongly affect my life. I do not need to get a driver license to use
						an autonomous vehicle. My mom was a doctor and my father is the only one who works to take care
						of the family, therefore, on working days it is barely possible to spend enough time with the
						family. The time we can get together is only on weekends. We always go to a supermarket and
						spend half of the time in the car. My dad is the only one who has a driver licence so he can
						barely participate in our talks. If we have an autonomous car, my father can safely join our
						conversion on the way to the supermarket. Moreover, my father will not have to worry about
						having to take my family shopping if he is the only one with a driver’s license. Autonomous
						vehicles will be a proper solution. </p>
					<p>If autonomous vehicles can freely drive on the road, it will make me relax when driving for work
						and I can even sleep or read newspapers in the car. If everyone thinks like me, there may be
						more cars on the road because driving an autonomous car is extremely easy and causes more
						traffic jams. </p>
