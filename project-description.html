						<h1>Project Idea</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>Overview </h2>
					<p>In the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries, people are restricted from going
						out and that greatly affects the quality of their meals. The project we decided to implement is
						a food and recipe web application that organizes a list of recipes based on the ingredients in
						the user’s kitchen. It is expected to solve the problem of not knowing how to use the
						ingredients at home and how to buy the ingredients at home. Provide the idea of what to cook
						according to the corresponding ingredients, and the recipes of various delicious foods can teach
						users to cook. </p>
					<h2>Motivation </h2>
					<p>Under the background of the epidemic, many cities in many areas were blocked, and people had to
						order takeout to eat. At the same time, under the influence of this, people began to get used to
						ordering takeout. But at present, the price of takeout is generally high, and many people can't
						afford the price. So in order to solve this problem, we encourage you to buy food materials
						online through this project and make a delicious meal with the remaining food materials at home.
						This greatly saves money and is clean and hygienic. The most important point is that this
						project can enable even a person who can't cook to make delicious dishes. </p>
					<h2>Description </h2>
					<p>After discussion within the group, the team’s understanding of the project idea is not only
						limited to the prototype of the project, but carefully considered some feasible specific
						functions which are shown below. </p>
					<p>The first function is an account system.

						After creating an account, users can log in, log out, and manage the profile. It would show a
						profile card where users can modify their personal information. Furthermore, users can have
						their account access more functions, such as posting recipes, managing recipes and writing a
						comment for a recipe. In addition, only registered users can save and collect their favourite
						recipes. </p>
					<p>The second function is the virtual kitchen and pantry pages.

						Users can go to the profile page to access the pantry function. On the pantry page, the user can
						input the ingredient’s name and select the ingredient. When the user clicks the search recipes
						button. The system will return related recipes. Registered users can record what ingredients
						users have in the real kitchen like ingredients so that the system can recommend a suitable
						recipe for those ingredients. This feature is mainly designed to solve the problem that users
						cannot go outside or do not want to go outside to buy ingredients. They are limited to having
						the remaining ingredients at home and would like to quickly cook, so as to find a suitable
						recipe through this application. Therefore, it is very convenient for users to find the proper
						recipes they want. </p>
					<p>The third function is step-by-step instructions.

						This feature is the core feature. Each recipe will have detailed descriptions of ingredients and
						cooking methods. Besides, step-by-step instructions with pictures or videos will be applied to
						help the user to cook. Step-by-step instructions pages should contain three parts which are
						recipe information, ingredients and instructions. For the first part, this section will show the
						recipe photo and its author. All the related tags will be shown as well. If users want to see
						more similar recipes, they can click on the tag. The website will look through the database
						again and show the recipes containing this tag. The second part is ingredients, all the specific
						names and amounts will be shown. Besides, this part is designed to be a checkbox that users
						could check if they have those ingredients. For the last part is instructions, detailed steps
						will be offered with pictures or videos. Users could use those for references. Now there is a
						question: how can we get recipes? There are two ways to collect recipes for the application. The
						first way is to collect recipe information from google, we could add some basic typical recipes
						into the origin database such as making a chocolate cake and barbecue chicken. Then we will
						invite existing users to contribute and share their own recipes. If a recipe gets a number of
						likes, we will give a bonus to the writer and encourage more users to write their original
						recipes and share their cooking skills to make the website more active. </p>
					<p>The fourth is buying ingredients online

						This function can help users buy missing ingredients online. The system connects Amazon Fresh
						which allows customers to purchase ingredients online. And the list of ingredients can also be
						saved to the album, which is convenient for users to view.

						Buy the missing ingredients with one click according to your favourite recipe. Users often feel
						worried because they can't buy suitable ingredients. For example, I would like to eat Tom yum
						which is a famous Thai food, but I do not have the required ingredients and do not know where I
						can get the ingredients I need. Making unfamiliar dishes is a very troublesome thing. I hope
						this feature will make things easier. Here we also have a question: how do online purchasing
						ingredients work? We still have two ways to implement that feature. First, as mentioned above,
						when the website has enough traffic we will email Amazon Fresh to request cooperation and try to
						connect with Amazon Fresh to buy ingredients. Secondly, if the application has been successful
						and we have enough funds, we could hire couriers to deliver fresh ingredients from shops
						including coles and so on. Of course, this service is only in Australia. We will also provide a
						map with locations of ingredients shops through google map API so that users know where to buy
						related ingredients.

						On a recipe page, the user has previously entered that there are ingredients at home, so the
						system will quickly display what ingredients the user lacks under this recipe. There is a
						one-click buy button under the lack of ingredients. Then the user needs to fill in the receiving
						address and receiving time. Pay the order by bank card or PayPal. After the payment is
						successful, the purchase request will be sent to the supermarket or Amazon, and the delivery
						clerk will deliver the ingredients to the door. </p>
					<p>The last part includes some small features from our brainstorming. Users can like recipes and
						give comments to recipes. Our application could be a community that focuses on recipe sharing.
						Additionally, in some recipes with allergens such as milk and peanut, there will be a warning on
						the page. This function allows users to know the recipe of health risks such as allergies and so
						on. Lastly, users can create collections to save a recipe and check saved recipes on the profile
						page. </p>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies </h2>
					<p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented. The group
						decided to use this as the back-end language. Spring Boot which is a Java backend framework is
						an option to build the project's backend. In order to make the application across all platforms,
						Flutter will be used. So, we can use Android studio and Vscode to write code. MyBatis is a
						persistence framework with support for custom SQL, stored procedures and advanced mappings.
						Mybatis can reduce our workload to access the database. Mysql is the world's most popular
						open-source database. Moreover, HTML and CSS will be used for the front-end implement because we
						need to do a web application project. In the testing part, Postman can be used to do API testing
						and Junit can test key business functions. We also need an Android device and an iPhone to do
						usability testing. In the deployment part, we can set up a cloud machine in AWS and use Docker
						to deploy the project's backend. </p>
					<h2>Skills Required </h2>
					<p>We need to be familiar with Java statements to implement functions. To build the interface,
						Flutter is a suitable option because Flutter is a cross-platform, open-source mobile SDK built
						by Dart. In addition, it is necessary to design a good-looking web page through HTML and CSS.
						Some simple instructions are implemented through Javascript. Also, it must be familiar with
						database statements to complete the addition, modification, and deletion of information, such as
						the creation of new user accounts and the correction of user information as well as the store of
						the recipes’ details. In order to deploy the application, we need to have a cloud virtual
						machine such as EC2 in AWS. To operate the cloud machine, we should learn Linux. It is not easy
						to learn all of them, but there are so many online resources and related documentation for these
						technologies. In fact, it is not easy to implement these because we need to master many
						cutting-edge frameworks. But a lot of knowledge can be found on the programming website. We
						believe we can learn it well as long as we work hard. </p>
					<h2>Outcome </h2>
					<p>If this project is successful, it will greatly solve people's concerns when cooking. In many
						circumstances, people might not know what to eat, but this website can give people some hints
						and let them know what to eat. Also in many situations, people do not know how to cook, this
						website will help them cook step by step. It can be said that this project greatly saves users'
						time and reduces users' anxiety. If this project continues, it will give more people the
						opportunity to cook. Let people who cannot cook or do not bother to cook have one more chance to
						like cooking. </p>
