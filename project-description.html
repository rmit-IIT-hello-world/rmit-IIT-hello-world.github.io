						<h1>Project Description</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>Overview </h2>
					<h3>Topic</h3>
					<p>The project we decided to implement is a food and recipe sharing web application that organizes 
						a list of recipes based on the ingredients in the user’s kitchen and allows people to share their
						 own recipes to other users. It is expected to solve the problem of not knowing how to use the 
						 ingredients at home as well as giving ideas for what to make when you don’t have something specific
						  in mind. We hope to finalize a website with a user-friendly interface that all ages of users can 
						  enjoy.  
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to achieve this goal, some basic challenges we may face are as follows: the survey of the 
						target user groups of the website, the specific implementation of the website, and the operation 
						of the website after it goes to be deployed. 
					</p>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>With the rapid advancement of the information society, more and more people are concerned about 
						their own health problems from all aspects. As an indispensable part of people's survival, diet 
						is closely related to people's health. Eating out may encounter various problems, such as the 
						taste of the food is not exactly the same as expected, high-end restaurants have guaranteed food
						 quality but are expensive, and cheaper restaurants may not be able to ensure the quality of 
						 food, so cooking at home has become a trend that could encounter both quality and the cost. 
						 Today's society is an information explosion society, people can easily obtain any information 
						 they want from the Internet, so the original intention of this project is to give people more 
						 channels to share and receive food-related information. 
					</p>
					<p>Under the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries, many cities and many areas were
						 blocked, so that people had to order takeout to eat. At present, the price of takeout is generally 
						 high, and many people can't afford the price. People are restricted from going out and that greatly 
						 affects the quality of their meals. In order to solve this problem, we encourage you to buy food
						  materials online through this project and make a delicious meal with the remaining food materials 
						  at home. This greatly saves money and is clean and hygienic. The most important point is that this 
						  project can enable even a person who can't cook to make delicious dishes. 
					</p>
					<h3>Landscape </h3>
					<p>About some competitors of this website, such as simply recipe, yummy website, the functions of 
						these websites are roughly the same as our product functions, which is reflected in some 
						high-priority and medium-priority parts, such as account system, scoring system, comment system. 
						Our application also has innovative features including ingredients shopping system and cross 
						platform. Users can easily purchase ingredients via Amazon Fresh and learn new recipes on their 
						mobile phone and computer.

					<h2>Roles</h2>
					<p>This project will carry out different contents in different cycles. At the same time, 
						the group will change everyone's role when the end of a cycle because it is difficult 
						for the team to decide what role the group members are suitable for in this project. 
						Only through the role-playing of one cycle can gradually realize the skills the group 
						members are good at. Of course, hoping every team member can find their advantages. 
						If the member does not find strong skills, it doesn't matter. The role of the team 
						can help each other. The group divide the project into four cycles: the first cycle 
						is the project plan, the second cycle is the project design, the third cycle is the
						 project development, and the last cycle is the project implementation.

							<li>
								Project Manager:  
							  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
								<li>The project manager is responsible for assigning resources, prioritizing and coordinating 
									communication among team members. To sum up, it is to keep the project team focused 
									on the right goals. The project manager should also establish a set of working methods
									 to ensure the integrity and quality of the project artifacts. In this project team, 
									 everyone is a project manager, and everyone needs full participation in the project. 
									 Project managers need to constantly discuss and exchange ideas and solutions. 
								</li>								
							  </ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								Demand analyst:  
								<ul>
									<li>
										Demand analysts need to carefully study the needs of people in the current market 
										and make suggestions for the project's functions. Put forward suggestions and 
										requirements for future projects. In this project team, everyone is a requirement
										 analyst. Each member will collect the demand writing plan. Clear the main body 
										 and content of the project, laying the groundwork for future design, development
										  and implementation. 
									</li>
								</ul>

						  </ol>
						</li>
						<li>Project Design	 
						  <ol>
							<li>
								UI designer： 
							  <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
								<li>
									UI designers lead and coordinate the prototyping and formal design of Web interface 
									by following methods:
									<ul style="list-style-type:square">
										<li>
											Get requirements for the Web interface （including usability requirements）. 
										</li>
										<li>
											Build Web page prototypes. 
										</li>
										<li>
											The web prototype design is tested in group meetings. 
										</li>
										<li>
											And the appropriate feedback on the Web interface implementation plan
											 (created by team members, such as project managers and Development 
											 engineers) is needed. 
										</li>
									</ul> 
								</li>

								<li>
									In this cycle, every member will participate in the UI design work, whether prototype 
									design or implementation plan should be the result of collective discussion and 
									democratic deliberation.

					  <li>Project Development	 
						<ol>
						  <li>
							Web Developer:  
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
							  <li>This is the most important role to write code for Web applications running directly 
								  on browsers. Developers understand the complexity of the operating system such as
								   macOS and Windows, the development environment, and the framework for writing 
								   software on these operating systems. This includes Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot,
								   HTML5/CSS and SQL server. In this cycle, team members should learn as much as 
								   possible about programming languages and frameworks, to better participate in 
								   the development of projects.
								</li>							  
							</ul>

							Test Engineer:  
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
