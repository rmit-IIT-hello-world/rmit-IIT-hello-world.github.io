						<h1>Project Description</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>Overview </h2>
					<h3>Topic</h3>
					<p>The project we decided to implement is a food and recipe sharing web application that organizes 
						a list of recipes based on the ingredients in the user’s kitchen and allows people to share their
						 own recipes to other users. It is expected to solve the problem of not knowing how to use the 
						 ingredients at home as well as giving ideas for what to make when you don’t have something specific
						  in mind. We hope to finalize a website with a user-friendly interface that all ages of users can 
						  enjoy.  
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to achieve this goal, some basic challenges we may face are as follows: the survey of the 
						target user groups of the website, the specific implementation of the website, and the operation 
						of the website after it goes to be deployed. 
					</p>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>With the rapid advancement of the information society, more and more people are concerned about 
						their own health problems from all aspects. As an indispensable part of people's survival, diet 
						is closely related to people's health. Eating out may encounter various problems, such as the 
						taste of the food is not exactly the same as expected, high-end restaurants have guaranteed food
						 quality but are expensive, and cheaper restaurants may not be able to ensure the quality of 
						 food, so cooking at home has become a trend that could encounter both quality and the cost. 
						 Today's society is an information explosion society, people can easily obtain any information 
						 they want from the Internet, so the original intention of this project is to give people more 
						 channels to share and receive food-related information. 
					</p>
					<p>Under the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries, many cities and many areas were
						 blocked, so that people had to order takeout to eat. At present, the price of takeout is generally 
						 high, and many people can't afford the price. People are restricted from going out and that greatly 
						 affects the quality of their meals. In order to solve this problem, we encourage you to buy food
						  materials online through this project and make a delicious meal with the remaining food materials 
						  at home. This greatly saves money and is clean and hygienic. The most important point is that this 
						  project can enable even a person who can't cook to make delicious dishes. 
					</p>
					<h3>Landscape </h3>
					<p>About some competitors of this website, such as simply recipe, yummy website, the functions of 
						these websites are roughly the same as our product functions, which is reflected in some 
						high-priority and medium-priority parts, such as account system, scoring system, comment system. 
						Our application also has innovative features including ingredients shopping system and cross 
						platform. Users can easily purchase ingredients via Amazon Fresh and learn new recipes on their 
						mobile phone and computer. 
					</p>
					
					<h2>Tools and Technologies </h2>
					<p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented. The group
						decided to use this as the back-end language. Spring Boot which is a Java backend framework is
						an option to build the project's backend. In order to make the application across all platforms,
						Flutter will be used. So, we can use Android studio and Vscode to write code. MyBatis is a
						persistence framework with support for custom SQL, stored procedures and advanced mappings.
						Mybatis can reduce our workload to access the database. Mysql is the world's most popular
						open-source database. Moreover, HTML and CSS will be used for the front-end implement because we
						need to do a web application project. In the testing part, Postman can be used to do API testing
						and Junit can test key business functions. We also need an Android device and an iPhone to do
						usability testing. In the deployment part, we can set up a cloud machine in AWS and use Docker
						to deploy the project's backend. </p>
					<h2>Skills Required </h2>
					<p>We need to be familiar with Java statements to implement functions. To build the interface,
						Flutter is a suitable option because Flutter is a cross-platform, open-source mobile SDK built
						by Dart. In addition, it is necessary to design a good-looking web page through HTML and CSS.
						Some simple instructions are implemented through Javascript. Also, it must be familiar with
						database statements to complete the addition, modification, and deletion of information, such as
						the creation of new user accounts and the correction of user information as well as the store of
						the recipes’ details. In order to deploy the application, we need to have a cloud virtual
						machine such as EC2 in AWS. To operate the cloud machine, we should learn Linux. It is not easy
						to learn all of them, but there are so many online resources and related documentation for these
						technologies. In fact, it is not easy to implement these because we need to master many
						cutting-edge frameworks. But a lot of knowledge can be found on the programming website. We
						believe we can learn it well as long as we work hard. </p>
					<h2>Outcome </h2>
					<p>If this project is successful, it will greatly solve people's concerns when cooking. In many
						circumstances, people might not know what to eat, but this website can give people some hints
						and let them know what to eat. Also in many situations, people do not know how to cook, this
						website will help them cook step by step. It can be said that this project greatly saves users'
						time and reduces users' anxiety. If this project continues, it will give more people the
						opportunity to cook. Let people who cannot cook or do not bother to cook have one more chance to
						like cooking. </p>
