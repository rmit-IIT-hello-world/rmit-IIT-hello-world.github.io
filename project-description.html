						<h1>Project Description</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>Overview </h2>
					<h3>Topic</h3>
					<p>The project we decided to implement is a food and recipe sharing web application that organizes
						a list of recipes based on the ingredients in the user’s kitchen and allows people to share
						their
						own recipes to other users. It is expected to solve the problem of not knowing how to use the
						ingredients at home as well as giving ideas for what to make when you don’t have something
						specific
						in mind. We hope to finalize a website with a user-friendly interface that all ages of users can
						enjoy.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to achieve this goal, some basic challenges we may face are as follows: the survey of
						the
						target user groups of the website, the specific implementation of the website, and the operation
						of the website after it goes to be deployed.
					</p>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>With the rapid advancement of the information society, more and more people are concerned about
						their own health problems from all aspects. As an indispensable part of people's survival, diet
						is closely related to people's health. Eating out may encounter various problems, such as the
						taste of the food is not exactly the same as expected, high-end restaurants have guaranteed food
						quality but are expensive, and cheaper restaurants may not be able to ensure the quality of
						food, so cooking at home has become a trend that could encounter both quality and the cost.
						Today's society is an information explosion society, people can easily obtain any information
						they want from the Internet, so the original intention of this project is to give people more
						channels to share and receive food-related information.
					</p>
					<p>Under the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries, many cities and many areas were
						blocked, so that people had to order takeout to eat. At present, the price of takeout is
						generally
						high, and many people can't afford the price. People are restricted from going out and that
						greatly
						affects the quality of their meals. In order to solve this problem, we encourage you to buy food
						materials online through this project and make a delicious meal with the remaining food
						materials
						at home. This greatly saves money and is clean and hygienic. The most important point is that
						this
						project can enable even a person who can't cook to make delicious dishes.
					</p>
					<h3>Landscape </h3>
					<p>About some competitors of this website, such as simply recipe, yummy website, the functions of
						these websites are roughly the same as our product functions, which is reflected in some
						high-priority and medium-priority parts, such as account system, scoring system, comment system.
						Our application also has innovative features including ingredients shopping system and cross
						platform. Users can easily purchase ingredients via Amazon Fresh and learn new recipes on their
						mobile phone and computer.
					</p>



					<h2>Aims</h2>
					<p>
						The major aim of the project is to build a stage for people to share recipes and encourage more
						people cooking by themselves. Under the situation of the pandemic and coronavirus, people will
						spend more time having meal at home. Those who are not able to cook might have to learn to do it
						and they can use the website as the guidebook. Individuals might be attracted by those
						interesting recipes and start cooking. For those who are good at cooking, they can share the
						recipes to others to help them studying.
					</p>
					<p>
						To achieve the major aim, we should finish some short term aims step by step. The first step is
						of course the implementation of the website. A lot of things should be done to finish this step
						such as the user research, functional design and interface design and so on. The user research
						is to define the major user groups, to analyse the preferences of different target user groups,
						and then make reasonable adjustments to the page interface and functional design of the website
						based on these. After the preparation and the design stage of the website, the group should
						consider the implementation of it. Our goal is to make the website functionality within three
						months by following the Agile mode. Agile mode is suitable for short term implementations and it
						requires the group to communicate more during the implementation which may encourage the group
						finishing the implementation with quality and efficiency. The second aim for the project is to
						operate the website reasonably. In the initial stage after the website goes deployment, the aim
						is to attract more users. My first plan is to pay for those vloggers and famous chefs to use the
						website and share their recipes, then their original followers would be attracted. After that
						other people may be gradually attracted. Following the initial beginning of the website, what we
						should do is to ensuring the activeness of existing users. The plan is to set a seasonally
						cooking competition that users can upload their own cooking videos. The champion is determined
						through voting by other users. The prize may not be pure cash but similar to the one-month egg
						supply of the champion family. At the same time, we must also actively absorb users’ opinions,
						carefully listen to users’ suggestions, make changes to the unreasonable design of the website
						and fix possible bugs in a timely manner to make sure the website can go further continually.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also predicted some things that would cause things to develop differently from the
						expectation. For example, the website development process is not smooth enough which would cause
						a delaying of the deployment. In this case, the team should strengthen communication, find the
						reason for the slow progress and correct it. In addition, the initial number of users may not
						meet expectations. In this case, we can increase advertising efforts to let more people know
						about our website.
					</p>

					<h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
					<h3>Beginning</h3>
					<p>
						At the beginning of assignment two, each team member introduced their own project idea to the
						team members. At the beginning we chose the disaster warning system from Zhihao, but considering
						its implementation difficulty and the potential market competitiveness may be weaker, so at the
						last several days of assignment two, we decided to adopt Heran’s recipes sharing website that
						includes cooperation with local supermarket as ingredients suppliers. . Afterward, we collected
						fundamental metrics involving food from social perspectives, namely ration demand, nutrition
						supplement, healthy components, ingredients’ condition, etc.
						<br>
						<br>
						Besides, relative aspects relating are also researched, we pay attention to the eating style in
						modern society, the situation of pandemic and coronavirus, the demand for fitness, development
						of food industry, competition between food companies. Especially, we also define general demands
						of the user when they engage technological advances related to ration, so we can identify what
						users are likely to expect from the application or what the application can help them to
						complete necessary tasks. Decisions related to the mutual performance of our team are considered
						by all of the team members, together we choose open-resources, software, an application which is
						responsible for communication. Meeting outside of class is also an important part that we have
						successfully arranged since we formed a group, the timetable was created so that each member’s
						availability could be recorded and compared.
						<br>
						<br>
						Our team operates meetings efficiently depending on changes of weeks, for instance, we implement
						small meeting without adequacy of team members through a specific week before we have the
						ability to conduct the whole group meeting.
					</p>

					<h3>Stages</h3>
					<p>
						We are now on the stage of the preparing and planning for the implementation of the application.
						Before the implementation, what we should consider is that the website requires a dataset that
						can store all of the user information and recipe details. The quantity of the data is extremely
						large so we have to borrow or buy the server to store those data. To build our own product, it
						is necessary to design a logo for website. Then we should consider the UX design of the website
						interface. The design should follow the principle of concise and clear appearance and
						substantial content. In the case of sufficient funds, we can consider hiring a professional
						designer to design the logo and website. After that, we should do the user research. As
						mentioned above, the user research is to define the major user groups, to analyse the
						preferences of different target user groups, and then make reasonable adjustments to the page
						interface and functional design of the website based on these. In case we are not able to do the
						user research now, we still carefully considered some feasible specific functions which are
						shown below.
						<br>
						<br>
						The first function is an account system.
						<br>
						After creating an account, users can log in, log out, and manage the profile. It would show a
						profile card where users can modify their personal information. Furthermore, users can have
						their account access more functions, such as posting recipes, managing recipes and writing a
						comment for a recipe. In addition, only registered users can save and collect their favourite
						recipes. This function would be the initial one during the implementation because we need to
						implement two ports - on the user side and the administrator side for better management of user
						information. Administrator users have more authority and permissions such as deleting
						inappropriate posts and comments for ordinary users.
						<br>
						<br>
						The second function is the virtual kitchen and pantry pages.
						<br>
						Users can go to the profile page to access the pantry function. On the pantry page, the user can
						input the ingredient’s name and select the ingredient. When the user clicks the search recipes
						button. The system will return related recipes. Registered users can record what ingredients
						users have in the real kitchen like ingredients so that the system can recommend a suitable
						recipe for those ingredients. This feature is mainly designed to solve the problem that users
						cannot go outside or do not want to go outside to buy ingredients. They are limited to having
						the remaining ingredients at home and would like to quickly cook, so as to find a suitable
						recipe through this application. Therefore, it is very convenient for users to find the proper
						recipes they want.
						<br>
						<br>
						The third function is step-by-step instructions.
						<br>
						This feature is the core feature. Each recipe will have detailed descriptions of ingredients and
						cooking methods. Besides, step-by-step instructions with pictures or videos will be applied to
						help the user to cook. Step-by-step instructions pages should contain three parts which are
						recipe information, ingredients and instructions. For the first part, this section will show the
						recipe photo and its author. All the related tags will be shown as well. If users want to see
						more similar recipes, they can click on the tag. The website will look through the database
						again and show the recipes containing this tag. The second part is ingredients, all the specific
						names and amounts will be shown. Besides, this part is designed to be a checkbox that users
						could check if they have those ingredients. For the last part is instructions, detailed steps
						will be offered with pictures or videos. Users could use those for references. Now there is a
						question: how can we get recipes? There are two ways to collect recipes for the application. The
						first way is to collect recipe information from google, we could add some basic typical recipes
						into the origin database such as making a chocolate cake and barbecue chicken. Then we will
						invite existing users to contribute and share their own recipes. If a recipe gets a number of
						likes, we will give a bonus to the writer and encourage more users to write their original
						recipes and share their cooking skills to make the website more active.
						<br>
						<br>
						The fourth is buying ingredients online
						<br>
						This function can help users buy missing ingredients online. The system connects Amazon Fresh
						which allows customers to purchase ingredients online. And the list of ingredients can also be
						saved to the album, which is convenient for users to view.
						<br>
						<br>
						Buy the missing ingredients with one click according to your favourite recipe. Users often feel
						worried because they can't buy suitable ingredients. For example, I would like to eat Tom yum
						which is a famous Thai food, but I do not have the required ingredients and do not know where I
						can get the ingredients I need. Making unfamiliar dishes is a very troublesome thing. I hope
						this feature will make things easier. Here we also have a question: how do online purchasing
						ingredients work? We still have two ways to implement that feature. First, as mentioned above,
						when the website has enough traffic, we will email Amazon Fresh to request cooperation and try
						to connect with Amazon Fresh to buy ingredients. Secondly, if the application has been
						successful and we have enough funds, we could hire couriers to deliver fresh ingredients from
						shops including Coles and so on. Of course, this service is only in Australia. We will also
						provide a map with locations of ingredients shops through google map API so that users know
						where to buy related ingredients.
						<br>
						<br>
						On a recipe page, the user has previously entered that there are ingredients at home, so the
						system will quickly display what ingredients the user lacks under this recipe. There is a
						one-click buy button under the lack of ingredients. Then the user needs to fill in the receiving
						address and receiving time. Pay the order by bank card or PayPal. After the payment is
						successful, the purchase request will be sent to the supermarket or Amazon, and the delivery
						clerk will deliver the ingredients to the door.
						<br>
						<br>
						In addition, the group considered some other small features from our brainstorming. Users can
						like recipes and give comments to recipes. Our application could be a community that focuses on
						recipe sharing. Even though it might increase server pressure, allowing users to maintain
						communication can ensure the site’s activity and user stickiness. Additionally, in some recipes
						with allergens such as milk and peanut, there will be a warning on the page. This function
						allows users to know the recipe of health risks such as allergies and so on. Lastly, users can
						create collections to save a recipe and check saved recipes on the profile page. This function
						may also cause the server pressure but it can increase the frequency of user visiting the
						website. Taking further consideration, if technology permits, we can build an artificial
						intelligence backend to recommend relevant recipes to users according to their visit habits and
						preferences to increase the attractiveness of the website to users. This one might not be easy
						to implement but we can work towards this goal. Generally, the whole team made contributions to
						do the planning of the websites and all members gave their suggestions to gain reasonable and
						necessary functions.
					</p>

					<h3>Dead ends</h3>
					<p>
						In the process, we encountered several dead ends, mainly about sources, thought restrictions,
						advertisements, and controversial situations. As we all know, the time spent in the development
						process, the money and the quality of the final results cannot be achieved at the same time.
						During the discussion, some people thought that some time could be sacrificed in order to save
						money and ensure product quality. Others think that products should be made as soon as possible
						to ensure that funds are invested in the operation and promotion of the website. Each team
						member has different abilities, thinking, and working styles, so we also have disputes related
						to the direction of our application development, and it is very time-consuming to resolve these
						controversial obstacles.
					</p>

					<h3>Further plan</h3>
					<p>
						If we will handle the project to another team, what we can provide is the detailed project
						description and a fidelity prototype. The detailed project description includes not only the
						description but the user stories and the Acceptance Quiteria of each function, the priority of
						each function and the flow chart of the functions to show how did the group design and consider
						the project and to help the new group understand better about the project which let them can get
						started faster.
					</p>

					<h2>Roles</h2>
					<p>This project will carry out different contents in different cycles. At the same time,
						the group will change everyone's role when the end of a cycle because it is difficult
						for the team to decide what role the group members are suitable for in this project.
						Only through the role-playing of one cycle can gradually realize the skills the group
						members are good at. Of course, hoping every team member can find their advantages.
						If the member does not find strong skills, it doesn't matter. The role of the team
						can help each other. The group divide the project into four cycles: the first cycle
						is the project plan, the second cycle is the project design, the third cycle is the
						project development, and the last cycle is the project implementation.

							<h4>Account system (mentioned in stage part)</h4>
							<img width="500" src="/images/mvf1.1.png" alt="">
							<img width="500" src="/images/mvf1.2.png" alt="">
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Recommendation recipe sliders</h4>
							<p>User can select a recommended recipe slider picture and navigate to the recipe page
								directly. The slider is shown on the homepage which has four pages, and they are the
								best four liked recipes of the website. The slider can switch the pages automatically
								and users can also switch pages by clicking the button under the slices. Furthermore,
								the user can access the recipe detail page directly by simply clicking the picture. </p>

							<img width="500" src="/images/mvf3.2.png" alt="">

						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Step-by-step instructions (mentioned in stage part)</h4>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Shopping helper (mentioned in stage part)</h4>
							<p>This function is difficult to develop and we need to contact with amazon so this feature
								is in the medium priority. </p>
						</li>

					</ul>
					<h3>Medium priority part </h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Tags and searching </h4>
							<p>User can touch recommended tags or type in a recipe’s name or an ingredient’s name to
								search recipe. To help users find their suitable recipes, tags will be used in recipes.
								Those tags may contain key ingredients. Users will have a more pleasing searching
								experience because tags help them to target recipes more precisely. Tags are also
								structured in the system. The system provides various kinds of tags to help the user to
								find what they want rapidly. In the result page, the user can directly save recipes
								through the save button and see more about the recipe. </p>
								<img width="500" src="/images/search-result.png" alt="">

						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Comment system</h4>
							<p>Users can praise recipes. Highly praised recipes will be recommended by other users first
								when recommending recipes. At the same time, users can also comment on recipes. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Collection and Favorite function </h4>
							<p>Users can collect their favorite recipes. This function provides users with a function
								like favorites to facilitate users to view the recipes they have made or the recipes
								they have collected and commented on. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Low priority part</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Mobile version for our project</h4>
							<p>Optimize the web app into a mobile app so that users can use it quickly at any time. We
								need to have an initial web page version application then try to make the application
								run in other platforms. </p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Health risks and precaution (Allergy Prevention)</h4>
							<p>Assess the risk for each recipe to prevent diseases. When users choose a recipe, they
								will inform users of the health risks of this recipe and suggestions. For example,
								patients with diabetes cannot eat foods containing sugar, children cannot eat spicy
								food, etc., as an extension of the extension of tag method. This is one of the results
								of brainstorming and this feature is only the icing on the cake. </p>
						</li>

					</ul>

					<h3>Features not included in the project </h3>

					<ul>


						<li>
							<h4>Substitution </h4>
							<p>This function can help users replace some ingredients in the menu. For example, if some
								vegetarians cannot eat chicken, they can use this function to replace chicken with
								vegetarian chicken with a similar taste. At the same time, when users lack a certain
								ingredient, they can also use this function to replace the missing ingredient. The idea
								is surprisingly good but we have no idea to implement it. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Social media </h4>
							<p>Adding a social attribute to our application is not bad. Users can subscribe active users
								and check their activities. However, it is difficult for us to develop an application
								that can make friends. We must focus on user experience on viewing recipes with our
								limited development skills. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>HTML, CSS and JavaScript are core web front-end technologies for this project. The correct
							use of these tools can ensure the front-end presentation. </li>
						<li>Java is chosen to be the basic language for back-end development. Spring Boot is chosen to
							be the framework of the project, it uses a specific way to configure, so that developers no
							longer need to define boilerplate configurations. </li>
						<li>Maven and Git are used for the dependency control and the version control to make the
							collaboration between members become easier. </li>
						<li>The latest version of Android studio and IntelliJ IDEA CE will be chosen for coding. Flutter
							will be used to implement the application across all platforms. </li>
						<li>To build the database, MySQL will be the choice because it ranks second in the database
							popularity rankings released in April this year. The first is Oracle, but considering that
							some members of the team have experience in using MySQL, we decided to use it. </li>
						<li>We will need a standard laptop (Windows 10) builds to develop the project. </li>
						<li>Postman and Junit are used for testing, and we will do the usability test manually by using
							Android phone and an iPhone. </li>
						<li>Everyone in our group has relevant experience in HTML. There are two people who have studied
							java and know how to program through java. There are two people who have studied databases
							and have a brief understanding of MySQL. The group don't have too much experience about
							other tools, there are still many things to learn.

						</li>
					</ol>




					<h2>Testing</h2>
					<p>
						In different stages, we will test our project with different testing methods. In the designing
						stage, we will create a high-fidelity product prototype using Invision and try to test its
						usability. To test our prototype, we can organise interviews, invite our friends to use our
						prototype and obtain feedback. Prototype testing is very important for future development
						because we can identify problems as early as possible.
						<br><br>

						In software development, the frontend team and backend team have various testing tasks. Unit
						testing is key for this stage. Unit testing is a kind of software testing those developers write
						testing functions to test individual units or components of the software. Unit Testing is done
						during the development (coding phase) of an application. The purpose is to validate that each
						unit of the software code performs as expected. Backend team members should be responsible for
						testing business functions and database access functions. The frontend team not only should
						write unit testing functions, but also should UI testing. After finishing the initial version of
						the application, we will start alpha testing. We will take advantage of <a
							href="https://www.trymyui.com/">trymyui</a>, a professional usability testing website to
						acquire usability
						feedback. Our friends will be invited to participate in the alpha testing. 5 testing users also
						will be hired from trymyui to do testing.
					</p>



					<h2>Time Frame</h2>
					<p>
						Our time frame: <a
							href="https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/Introtoit655/Shared%20Documents/General/Time%20Frame.xlsx?d=wbda005a64f8d48668046c67306bf261f&csf=1&web=1&e=MEXndf ">Link</a>
					</p>




					<h2>Risks</h2>
					<p>
					<h3> Usability issues </h3>





					The UX design of our software is not conducted by professionals. This may result in lack of
					usability of our application’s interface. Customers may not feel comfortable or have difficulties
					using the software or may have confusion navigating to the functionality they desire. Some
					mitigation strategies for this risk are to take references of layouts of recipe websites while
					developing or conduct some usability testing to test customers’ reactions.

					<br><br>


					<h3>Lack of software development knowledge</h3>




					Our goal is to build a cross-platform application so the application should adapt multiple operating
					systems including Android, IOS and so on. To implement the application, what we have to learn
					includes but not limited to Java, AWS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flutter, Dart, Docker, Mysql and
					Spring Boot. Moreover, when we deploy our website, we also need to learn Linux and Nginx. Testing
					knowledge including unit testing and UI testing are also needed. Therefore, with multiple
					programming and techniques needing to be learnt, it is hard to guarantee that our team can obtain as
					expected. This may cause delays in our development schedule.


					<br><br>



					<h3>Sensitive Data leakage</h3>




					Another risk we may encounter is data leaks or breaches. Privacy or sensitive data can be leaked or
					hacked as user data is collected for our application. For example, passwords in the database.
					Another data risk we may be faced with is a lack of security controls. Security controls include
					things such as pass-codes and using bio-metrics to login into the application. As our application is
					still a prototype and under development, lack of security features will be a risk. Unauthorized
					individuals could access the user's account via malicious encryption attacks or sql attacks. To
					mitigate this risk, some easy methods can be applied, for example, users’ passwords should be
					encrypted through hash in the database.

					<h3> Fund shortage</h3>


					In the future, our recipe software could spread across the world market which needs more AWS
					services to maintain the software performance. In our early stage of software image, the budget
					could be designed to put into the software development. With an increasing number of users, due to
					the incomprehensive financial plan, such fund shortage may happen and cause potential harm towards
					stakeholders. Therefore, to prevent this risk, a dynamic and regular company financial analysis
					should be conducted to monitor the financial status and business plan should be adjusted
					accordingly.

					<h2>Group processes and communications</h2>
					<p>
						Our team usually maintains online communication through Microsoft Teams and WeChat. We have at
						least 2 group meetings each week using Microsoft Teams. We discuss progress and find problems
						and solve them. Each meeting lasts about half an hour to one hour. Our group usually creates a
						word document to easily assign tasks to everyone and to check progress. Sometimes we also use
						WeChat and email to communicate, for example to share documents and announcements. If our group
						members do not respond to the communications, we will let him know by email or WeChat. And tell
						him what’s happening.
