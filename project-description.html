						<h1>Project Description</h1>
					</header>
					<h2>Overview </h2>
					<h3>Topic</h3>
					<p>The project we decided to implement is a food and recipe sharing web application that organizes 
						a list of recipes based on the ingredients in the user’s kitchen and allows people to share their
						 own recipes to other users. It is expected to solve the problem of not knowing how to use the 
						 ingredients at home as well as giving ideas for what to make when you don’t have something specific
						  in mind. We hope to finalize a website with a user-friendly interface that all ages of users can 
						  enjoy.  
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to achieve this goal, some basic challenges we may face are as follows: the survey of the 
						target user groups of the website, the specific implementation of the website, and the operation 
						of the website after it goes to be deployed. 
					</p>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>With the rapid advancement of the information society, more and more people are concerned about 
						their own health problems from all aspects. As an indispensable part of people's survival, diet 
						is closely related to people's health. Eating out may encounter various problems, such as the 
						taste of the food is not exactly the same as expected, high-end restaurants have guaranteed food
						 quality but are expensive, and cheaper restaurants may not be able to ensure the quality of 
						 food, so cooking at home has become a trend that could encounter both quality and the cost. 
						 Today's society is an information explosion society, people can easily obtain any information 
						 they want from the Internet, so the original intention of this project is to give people more 
						 channels to share and receive food-related information. 
					</p>
					<p>Under the current Covid-19 epidemic situation in most countries, many cities and many areas were
						 blocked, so that people had to order takeout to eat. At present, the price of takeout is generally 
						 high, and many people can't afford the price. People are restricted from going out and that greatly 
						 affects the quality of their meals. In order to solve this problem, we encourage you to buy food
						  materials online through this project and make a delicious meal with the remaining food materials 
						  at home. This greatly saves money and is clean and hygienic. The most important point is that this 
						  project can enable even a person who can't cook to make delicious dishes. 
					</p>
					<h3>Landscape </h3>
					<p>About some competitors of this website, such as simply recipe, yummy website, the functions of 
						these websites are roughly the same as our product functions, which is reflected in some 
						high-priority and medium-priority parts, such as account system, scoring system, comment system. 
						Our application also has innovative features including ingredients shopping system and cross 
						platform. Users can easily purchase ingredients via Amazon Fresh and learn new recipes on their 
						mobile phone and computer. 
					</p>



					<h2>Aims</h2>
					<p>
						The major aim of the project is to build a stage for people to share recipes and encourage more people cooking by themselves. Under the situation of the pandemic and coronavirus, people will spend more time having meal at home. Those who are not able to cook might have to learn to do it and they can use the website as the guidebook. Individuals might be attracted by those interesting recipes and start cooking. For those who are good at cooking, they can share the recipes to others to help them studying. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To achieve the major aim, we should finish some short term aims step by step. The first step is of course the implementation of the website. A lot of things should be done to finish this step such as the user research, functional design and interface design and so on. The user research is to define the major user groups, to analyse the preferences of different target user groups, and then make reasonable adjustments to the page interface and functional design of the website based on these. After the preparation and the design stage of the website, the group should consider the implementation of it. Our goal is to make the website functionality within three months by following the Agile mode. Agile mode is suitable for short term implementations and it requires the group to communicate more during the implementation which may encourage the group finishing the implementation with quality and efficiency. The second aim for the project is to operate the website reasonably. In the initial stage after the website goes deployment, the aim is to attract more users. My first plan is to pay for those vloggers and famous chefs to use the website and share their recipes, then their original followers would be attracted. After that other people may be gradually attracted. Following the initial beginning of the website, what we should do is to ensuring the activeness of existing users. The plan is to set a seasonally cooking competition that users can upload their own cooking videos. The champion is determined through voting by other users. The prize may not be pure cash but similar to the one-month egg supply of the champion family. At the same time, we must also actively absorb users’ opinions, carefully listen to users’ suggestions, make changes to the unreasonable design of the website and fix possible bugs in a timely manner to make sure the website can go further continually.  
					</p>
					<p>
						I also predicted some things that would cause things to develop differently from the expectation. For example, the website development process is not smooth enough which would cause a delaying of the deployment. In this case, the team should strengthen communication, find the reason for the slow progress and correct it. In addition, the initial number of users may not meet expectations. In this case, we can increase advertising efforts to let more people know about our website.

					<h2>Roles</h2>
					<p>This project will carry out different contents in different cycles. At the same time, 
						the group will change everyone's role when the end of a cycle because it is difficult 
						for the team to decide what role the group members are suitable for in this project. 
						Only through the role-playing of one cycle can gradually realize the skills the group 
						members are good at. Of course, hoping every team member can find their advantages. 
						If the member does not find strong skills, it doesn't matter. The role of the team 
						can help each other. The group divide the project into four cycles: the first cycle 
						is the project plan, the second cycle is the project design, the third cycle is the
						 project development, and the last cycle is the project implementation.

								Project Manager:  
							  <ul>
								<li>The project manager is responsible for assigning resources, prioritizing and coordinating 
									communication among team members. To sum up, it is to keep the project team focused 
									on the right goals. The project manager should also establish a set of working methods
									 to ensure the integrity and quality of the project artifacts. In this project team, 
									 everyone is a project manager, and everyone needs full participation in the project. 
									 Project managers need to constantly discuss and exchange ideas and solutions.

							</li>
							<li>
								Demand analyst:  
								<ul>
									<li>
										Demand analysts need to carefully study the needs of people in the current market 
										and make suggestions for the project's functions. Put forward suggestions and 
										requirements for future projects. In this project team, everyone is a requirement
										 analyst. Each member will collect the demand writing plan. Clear the main body 
										 and content of the project, laying the groundwork for future design, development
										  and implementation.
