						<h1>Reflection</h1>
					</header>

					<p>This part illustrates the reflection of other group members and the group work. It contains
						people's thinking of what goes well during the work, which part should be improve in the work,
						what surpriting the individual the most during the work and what can people learn form the work.
					</p>

					<h2>Group reflection</h2>
					<p>
						By reading the collected reflections of individual team members, we can know a few common topics
						including leadership, pleasant surprise, the desire to have started earlier, and lack of IT
						knowledge. Another was that we should start our project earlier. Because we misestimate the
						workload, we were nervous before the deadline. We tried to figure out how to organize images on
						the web page and it took us some much time. One thing that was surprising would be that we
						communicate very well, every member is active and is assigned and finished without any major
						issues.

					</p>
					<p>Although Boan came to RMIT class in the first semester, he also made an outstanding performance.
						Because of his constant self-learning and hard work, he has become part of a web page project
						that can be completed today. Although his ability is limited at present, the future is
						limitless. Yingjian acts as our leader and brings our team very well. He works conscientiously
						and is responsible for every meeting. Besides, he has some unique views on some issues. Yi has
						done a lot in the group. She is very careful and teaches us HTML knowledge. Although we met
						various problems, we always discussed the problem on teams and tried to find out a solution.
						Sixue, as a new student of RMIT, is not familiar with coding. But he worked hard and finally
						made much progress with the help of the course guidance and his teacher's guidance. I hope he
						will make more contributions in his next assignment. Heran also performs his duties in teamwork.
						He completed the text and part of the code in his previous work. He has an indispensable
						contribution to the team. Zhihao, as another contributor to the team, always contribute a lot in
						silence. He is a skillful developer and eager to help players solve problems. Even if many
						problems are not very difficult, he is still patient. His character infects every member of the
						team. He contributed a lot to our team in terms of technology, and every team member can make
						progress through mutual help from team members. Lastly, it is satisfying to see that no
						reflection has sour words with regard to social interaction with other teammates. This means
						that everyone worked diligently and treated each other with respect.
					</p>
					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Yi Yang</h2>
					<p>
						What went well is that everyone in the group makes contributions for the assignment and members
						are friendly and efficiency during the meeting as well as during the communication. People are
						not hesitating to ask questions or figure our others’ mistake which is really helpful for
						keeping the progress of the assignment.
						<br>
						<br>
						What could be improve is that people could communicate even more to always let others know the
						status of each other. For example, if we set a due date for a task and people can updated the
						status of the task before due date in the chat box rather than show the whole result at the end.
						In this way, if there are certain mistakes, others can figure out them in time.
						<br>
						<br>
						What was surprising me is also what I can learn from the group. Members’ project ideas are full
						of imagination. They are not limited to the realization of software applications but are more
						about the combination of hardware and software. Even though this may require more skills and
						knowledge, I learn to think ideas and solve problems from multiple angles.

					<h2>Boan Cao</h2>
					<p>What I did well in this group learning activity was to complete the work assigned by the
						group carefully and to revise the deficiencies in a timely manner. I also have a sense of
						community and responsibility and enjoy working with others. However, I also realized my
						shortcomings during the group study. I did not take enough initiative myself and did not
						really put myself into it, but only completed the parts and tasks that I needed to complete.
						In future group activities, I will always remind myself to keep working hard and improving.
						This semester is the first semester of my university life, so I don't know much about the
						course and my classmates. I thought everyone was a fresher like me, but some of the group
						members in our group it was their last semester at university. This is what surprised me
						more, but at the same time I am grateful that they helped me a lot. During the group
						discussion, they pointed out my shortcomings and what could be improved. I also actively
						worked with them to revise what I had written, which taught me a lot and made me improve a
						lot. Through this group activity I also realized the importance of teamwork. When I work
						alone, I am not aware of my own shortcomings and problems. But in a group, we discuss and
						help each other, and we can get to know ourselves better so that we can improve faster. </p>

					<h2>Sixue Chen</h2>
					<p>In assignment1, I don’t know how to use css to beautify webpages. As a result, I only use
						basic html to make webpages in assignment1. This leads to my webpages not being very
						beautiful. In assignment2, I just learn from scratch About how to use css to beautify web
						pages, this is an improvement. And the team members pointed out some mistakes I made in the
						industry data very enthusiastically, for example, the data was not clear enough. I also
						modified this, and I am grateful to my team members, each of them is great. Our team has a
						clear division of labor at the beginning, and made a detailed plan about what each person
						needs to do, and everyone has provided good suggestions for the homework. cause the team
						members made a good time plan, this made us not drag the homework to the death line in the
						end, ha ha. </p>
					<p>My ability is lacking. At the beginning, I didn’t know how to clone some databases to modify
						it locally, and use some software. Under the guidance of the team members, I learned a lot.
						Regarding the imperfections, I think that some group members, including me, do not
						participate in group discussions frequently. I think it would be better if the group
						discussions become brainstorming. As for what surprised me, the production of the webpage
						was very professional, using professional terms such as JavaScript and css, and the beauty
						of the webpage surprised me.
					</p>

					<h2>Yingjian Di</h2>
					<p>In my opinion, all things, such as
						document writing, report writing and web page making, are very good. What we can
						strengthen is to make our project more detailed and accurately describe what to do at
						each step, because some parts of our project are imagined and not specifically tried, At
						the same time, the production of web pages surprised me because the web pages are simple
						and beautiful. At the same time, in this group work, I learned how to use CSS to
						beautify the web pages. I also learned to use GitHub to help the group complete the web
						pages. It is very useful because GitHub can help us share the same code for editing and
						will not interfere with each other.</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Heran Wang</h2>
					<p>Through this assignment, I really gained a lot. I learned how to use
						GIT and how to write code with VSCODE. And I can also make WEB
						front-end content. I think my team members are very good. They
						can meet on time, and they can help me guide my problems. Each
						of them is excellent and gives me support and help on the way I
						learn. I have encountered some difficulties in using CSS. Although
						this is not very difficult. But for me, this difficulty really
						delayed my whole day. Finally, Zhihao helped me solve this
						problem and finished the homework successfully. What impressed
						me most was that the work of programmers was not dull as ditch
						water. The help of team members will make me feel happy and happy
						to be a programmer in the future. To my surprise, what we did
						in this group work is so beautiful. The tacit agreement and
						cooperation between team members created a perfect job.
					</p>


					<hr class="major" />
					<h2>Zhihao Liang</h2>
					<p>As a part of a team, I found that everything becomes ordered and simple when there is a good team
						leader Yingjian. We share our progress day by day so that my team member can review other
						people's content or HTML code. I think our project will do better if we can plan our tasks
						earlier and finish them rather than submitting the job at the last time. I was very surprised at
						our team leader Yingjian. He is very responsible. He planned each meeting and decided what we
						need to do. Without Yingjian, we would have big trouble managing our meetings and d distributing
						tasks. In this assignment, I learned how to arrange my timetable reasonably and HTML knowledge.
						I have to arrange my time properly because I still have other courses’ tasks. Reasonable
						work-life balance is the most valuable thing I learned this time. Using HTML to develop a static
						website is an amazing experience. I need to know many kinds of HTML elements to organize our
						website including body, head and so on. I am very lucky to be a part of the group, and I have
						learned a lot of IT skills and general skills.
