						<h1>Reflection</h1>
					</header>

					<p>This part illustrates the reflection of other group members and the group work. It contains
						people's thinking of what goes well during the work, which part should be improve in the work,
						what surpriting the individual the most during the work and what can people learn form the work.

					<h2>Group reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Starting from assignment 3, we have more tasks than assignment 2. This means that we need
						to be clear about everyone's workload. Fortunately, the team members are very cooperative
						with the task arrangement of the team and everyone is assigned different tasks. We have no
						obvious differences in the process of assigning tasks and we get along well. The operation
						of the team seems to move forward at a steady pace. Our team is not backward compared with
						other teams.

					</p>
					<p>However, we still encountered some difficulties. The biggest difficulty is finding the right
						time to make a video meeting in Teams. Everyone is busy and will have their own arrangements.
						This will lead to some problems, including that we often fail to get in touch with Sixue and
						Sixue's task is not completed in time. Maintaining communication is really important because
						some communication factors can seriously hinder team progress. Meeting and effective
						communication is the only solution because the timeliness of the content conveyed by
						the conference is far more efficient than chatting in the Teams' message box. Everyone's
						real ideas that can only be displayed in meetings.
					</p>
					<p>
						What surprised our team is how much we depend on each other. This is precise because we are
						all doing the same project, even though everyone has a different division of labour. But each
						task is actually related and each module is interdependent. Therefore, the most important
						thing is that the team members synchronize their respective tasks and then summarize all
						the completed tasks before starting the next part of the task. If a person fails to complete
						his or her task at one stage, the progress of the whole team will stagnate and other members
						can not continue to work to complete the next task. Therefore, we learned that setting up the
						deadline for each task is very important to ensure that everyone can make good use of the time.
					</p>
					<p>
						In general, we learned a lot of knowledge, including convening meetings, communicating
						efficiently,
						setting up tasks and goals, making effective group plans, and inspiring team members to play
						excellent leadership to lead the team forward. Among them, early assignment of tasks and the
						establishment of clear deadlines are necessary.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, we learned a lot of practical tools during homework 3, including HTML/CSS, Java,
						Java Sprint, Git and InVision. Everyone has made some contributions to GIT.
					</p>

					<h2>Yi Yang</h2>
					<p>
						The workload of assignment three is much larger than assignment two, and the difficulty is also
						higher.
						<br>
						<br>
						The part worthy of recognition is that most of the team members actively participate in the
						weekly tutorials and respond in a timely manner in our usual communication. But the part that
						needs to be improved is that some team members need to be urged multiple times to complete the
						task, and the quality of the completion is not up to expectations. It requires other team
						members to rework this part of the work, which means that the specific team member did less
						contribution on this assignment. One thing I have to mention is that the group has set the
						approximate schedule requirements for each meeting, but almost every time, the team member just
						finishes his tasks before the last minute. The other team members reminded him many times but he
						did not give a response, so we decided to deduct his contribution value.
						<br>
						<br>
						Another aspect that certainly surprised me was that the prototype was completed in a timely and
						fast manner. Compared with textual work, the team members seem to prefer this kind of creative
						design work. During this assignment, I learned how to use invision to build a high fidelity
						prototype. I also learned that when communicating with each other, if the other party does not
						respond in time, I should make corresponding measures as soon as possible to stop the loss in
						time.

					<h2>Boan Cao</h2>
					<p>What I did well in this group learning activity was to complete the work assigned by the
						group carefully and to revise the deficiencies in a timely manner. I also have a sense of
						community and responsibility and enjoy working with others. However, I also realized my
						shortcomings during the group study. I did not take enough initiative myself and did not
						really put myself into it, but only completed the parts and tasks that I needed to complete.
						In future group activities, I will always remind myself to keep working hard and improving.
						This semester is the first semester of my university life, so I don't know much about the
						course and my classmates. I thought everyone was a fresher like me, but some of the group
						members in our group it was their last semester at university. This is what surprised me
						more, but at the same time I am grateful that they helped me a lot. During the group
						discussion, they pointed out my shortcomings and what could be improved. I also actively
						worked with them to revise what I had written, which taught me a lot and made me improve a
						lot. Through this group activity I also realized the importance of teamwork. When I work
						alone, I am not aware of my own shortcomings and problems. But in a group, we discuss and
						help each other, and we can get to know ourselves better so that we can improve faster. </p>
					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Sixue Chen</h2>
					<p>Every team member attended the meeting in time, and very few team members were late for the
						meeting, and everything went well. But some group members did not participate in the discussion
						well, including me. I need more knowledge to make my opinion. What surprised me was that the
						team members quickly solved the problems we encountered on invision, and constructed the
						framework and selected the right project in time. The website has many functions, which is very
						convenient and fast. </p>
					<p>At the beginning, I had very little understanding of invision, but the group members pulled me
						into the group, and then we discussed a lot about invision. Unfortunately, my time management
						and participation in group discussions were not high. I I hope I can understand more about
						invision. If the group members encounter difficulties, I can help solve them, but although I
						have learned a lot about invision from the beginning, it is not enough. I hope I can learn more
						about invision. I learn I talked about how to build a website and some of the main difficulties
						encountered when building a website, which helped me to build a website well in the future. This
						project stimulated my interest in using invision to build a website project, and I hope that I
						can cooperate well with the team members, and good time planning can help me solve my tasks
						faster. I learned a lot about invision, which is a very useful tool. And i learn about some key
						suggestions on how to make prototype projects, such as determining the scope of the website.
					</p>

					<h2>Yingjian Di</h2>
					The task of the group began very quickly, which makes me feel good. In the group meeting, everyone
					was assigned their tasks through discussion. In the next few weeks of the project, most team members
					can submit their homework on time.

					<br><br>

					However, in the following review process, the quality of some team members' work is not enough, and
					the problems of the group are gradually emerging. The more serious one is that when the team members
					encounter problems, they do not discuss and analyze them in time, but directly interpret them
					according to their views, which leads to the inconsistency between the answers and the questions,
					which slows down the completion progress of the group work, As a result, some contents were written
					many times before they passed the review.

					<br><br>

					To my surprise, prototype design is like painting. An excellent programmer is also a designer. I
					like to use Invision software to design our projects. In addition, what we do looks like a real
					website project. Communication is very important when teamwork is difficult. When we have problems,
					we need to exchange understanding, especially on key issues.

					<hr class="major" />

					<h2>Heran Wang</h2>
					<p>We were very active at the beginning of this assignment. Everyone is doing the assigned
						work and the whole homework is really good at the beginning. During the first two weeks
						of the operation, everyone can attend the meeting on time and report on their progress.
						The progress of the project seems smooth.
					</p>
					<p>
						But there will be some situations in the next few weeks, the most serious of which is
						timely communication. Everyone will have all kinds of things to delay the process of
						meetings. Although the whole project does not seriously affect the progress of the project,
						it does affect the progress of others. Because only when everyone completes his or her task
						can the rest of the team carry out the next task. Therefore, timely communication and timely
						allocation of tasks is really important.
					</p>
					<p>
						To my surprised, everyone is actively learning prototype design, learning the invision
						software. Designing prototype is really interesting to me. I like to use the invision
						software to design our project. Also, the moke up we do looks like a real website project.
					</p>
					<p>
						Through this assignment, I really gained a lot. I learned how to design prototype and
						how to use the invision software. I should write the report as soon as possible which
						is the thing I need to improve. Communication is really important in the team work. We
						need to exchange our mind and especially the new idea.
					</p>

					<h2>Zhihao Liang</h2>
					The group worked very well together. Our team members completed tasks quickly and didn't shirk
					responsibility. What could have been improved is my learning ability and writing skills. In
					hindsight, I should have learned related content before I start to finish my section in the report.
					Also, by doing this further formalization of the work process, keeping track of members’ progress
					would have been much faster.


					<br><br>
					Having worked in group projects, I was surprised by the quality of work provided by my teammates,
					and the speed of which they would respond. Something that I learned from group in this project was
					the importance of a good leader. Yingjian is a qualified leader. He also managed meetings and
					tracked working progress in assignment 3. Without Yingjian, we would have been scattered. In this
					project, I learned how to arrange my time in a proper way. Because other subjects also have
					assignments, I have to complete all things in a limited time. Reasonable balance of rest and study
					time is the most valuable thing I learned this time. I am lucky to be a member of the group, and I
					have learned a lot of useful and valuable knowledge on the way to cooperate with the group.

					<br><br>


					The GitHub activities log was a fair reflection of the group's work. We have uploaded our activities
					in the repository.
