						<h1>Reflection</h1>
					</header>

					<h2>Yi Yang reflection</h2>
					<p>
						What went well is that everyone in the group makes contributions for the assignment and members are friendly and efficiency during the meeting as well as during the communication. People are not hesitating to ask questions or figure our others’ mistake which is really helpful for keeping the progress of the assignment. 
						<br>
						<br>
						What could be improve is that people could communicate even more to always let others know the status of each other. For example, if we set a due date for a task and people can updated the status of the task before due date in the chat box rather than show the whole result at the end. In this way, if there are certain mistakes, others can figure out them in time. 
						<br>
						<br>
						What was surprising me is also what I can learn from the group. Members’ project ideas are full of imagination. They are not limited to the realization of software applications but are more about the combination of hardware and software. Even though this may require more skills and knowledge, I learn to think ideas and solve problems from multiple angles. </p>

					<h2>Sixue Chen reflection</h2>
					<p>In assignment1, I don’t know how to use css to beautify webpages. As a result, I only use basic html to make webpages in assignment1. This leads to my webpages not being very beautiful. In assignment2, I just learn from scratch About how to use css to beautify web pages, this is an improvement. And the team members pointed out some mistakes I made in the industry data very enthusiastically, for example, the data was not clear enough. I also modified this, and I am grateful to my team members, each of them is great. Our team has a clear division of labor at the beginning, and made a detailed plan about what each person needs to do, and everyone has provided good suggestions for the homework. cause the team members made a good time plan, this made us not drag the homework to the death line in the end, ha ha. </p>
					<p>My ability is lacking. At the beginning, I didn’t know how to clone some databases to modify it locally, and use some software. Under the guidance of the team members, I learned a lot. Regarding the imperfections, I think that some group members, including me, do not participate in group discussions frequently. I think it would be better if the group discussions become brainstorming. As for what surprised me, the production of the webpage was very professional, using professional terms such as JavaScript and css, and the beauty of the webpage surprised me.

					<h2>Yingjian Di reflection</h2>
					<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US">In my opinion, all things, such as document writing, report writing and web page making, are very good. What we can strengthen is to make our project more detailed and accurately describe what to do at each step, because some parts of our project are imagined and not specifically tried, At the same time, the production of web pages surprised me because the web pages are simple and beautiful. At the same time, in this group work, I learned how to use CSS to beautify the web pages. I also learned to use GitHub to help the group complete the web pages. It is very useful because GitHub can help us share the same code for editing and will not interfere with each other.</span><span data-ccp-props="{'335551550':6,'335551620':6}"> </span></p>

					<h2>Heran Wang reflection</h2>
					<p>Through this assignment, I really gained a lot. I learned how to use 
						GIT and how to write code with VSCODE. And I can also make WEB 
						front-end content. I think my team members are very good. They 
						can meet on time, and they can help me guide my problems. Each 
						of them is excellent and gives me support and help on the way I 
						learn. I have encountered some difficulties in using CSS. Although 
						this is not very difficult. But for me, this difficulty really 
						delayed my whole day. Finally, Zhihao helped me solve this 
						problem and finished the homework successfully. What impressed
						 me most was that the work of programmers was not dull as ditch 
						 water. The help of team members will make me feel happy and happy
						  to be a programmer in the future. To my surprise, what we did 
						  in this group work is so beautiful. The tacit agreement and 
						  cooperation between team members created a perfect job.

					<h2>Group reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Although Boan came to RMIT class in the first semester, he also made 
						an outstanding performance. Because of his constant self-learning and 
						hard work, he has become part of a web page project that can be 
						completed today. Although his ability is limited at present, the 
						future is limitless. I believe that if we can finish the homework well,
						 cannot do without his diligence and efforts. Yingjian acts as our 
						 leader and brings our team very well. He works conscientiously and 
						 is responsible for every meeting. He presides well. Especially his 
						 assignment for everyone is very suitable for this person. Besides, 
						 his document editing is excellent, and he has some unique views on 
						 some issues. Yi has done a lot in the group. She is very careful and
						  diligently, will find problems in time, and teach us to correct problems. 
						  Because of her presence in our team, we can make communication more 
						  frequent and close. Although sometimes members of a team look at problems 
						  differently. But after some discussion, we will get a final conclusion. 
						  Finally, we can reach a consensus on solving problems and make a perfect 
						  project. Sixue, as a new student of RMIT, is also a stranger to code. 
						  But he worked hard and finally made much progress in the guidance of 
						  his team and his teacher's guidance. Although there is still a lack 
						  of professional competence, it is great, and I hope he will make more
						  contributions in his next assignment. Heran also performs his duties 
						  in teamwork. He has the problem of being able to seek help from the 
						  team and solve problems carefully. He completed the text and part of 
						  the code in his previous work. It has an indispensable contribution 
						  to the team. Zhihao, as the most contributor to the team, always pays 
						  a lot in silence. He is very skilled and eager to help players solve
						   problems. Even if many problems are not very difficult, he will be 
						   very patient. His character and fact infect every member of the team. 
						   He can contribute a lot to our team in terms of technology, and 
						   every team member can make progress through mutual help from team 
						   members.
