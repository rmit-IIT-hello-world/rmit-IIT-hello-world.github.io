						<h1>Reflection</h1>

					<p>This part illustrates the reflection of other group members and the group work. It contains
						people's thinking of what goes well during the work, which part should be improve in the work,
						what surpriting the individual the most during the work and what can people learn form the work.

					<h2>Group reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Starting from assignment 3, we have more tasks than assignment 2. This means that we need 
						to be clear about everyone's workload. Fortunately, the team members are very cooperative 
						with the task arrangement of the team and everyone is assigned different tasks. We have no 
						obvious differences in the process of assigning tasks and we get along well. The operation 
						of the team seems to move forward at a steady pace. Our team is not backward compared with 
						other teams. 

					</p>
					<p>However, we still encountered some difficulties. The biggest difficulty is finding the right 
						time to make a video meeting in Teams. Everyone is busy and will have their own arrangements. 
						This will lead to some problems, including that we often fail to get in touch with Sixue and 
						Sixue's task is not completed in time. Maintaining communication is really important because 
						some communication factors can seriously hinder team progress. Meeting and effective 
						communication is the only solution because the timeliness of the content conveyed by 
						the conference is far more efficient than chatting in the Teams' message box. Everyone's 
						real ideas that can only be displayed in meetings. 
					</p>
					<p>
						What surprised our team is how much we depend on each other. This is precise because we are 
						all doing the same project, even though everyone has a different division of labour. But each 
						task is actually related and each module is interdependent. Therefore, the most important 
						thing is that the team members synchronize their respective tasks and then summarize all 
						the completed tasks before starting the next part of the task. If a person fails to complete 
						his or her task at one stage, the progress of the whole team will stagnate and other members 
						can not continue to work to complete the next task. Therefore, we learned that setting up the 
						deadline for each task is very important to ensure that everyone can make good use of the time. 
					</p>
					<p>
						In general, we learned a lot of knowledge, including convening meetings, communicating efficiently,
						 setting up tasks and goals, making effective group plans, and inspiring team members to play 
						 excellent leadership to lead the team forward. Among them, early assignment of tasks and the
						  establishment of clear deadlines are necessary. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, we learned a lot of practical tools during homework 3, including HTML/CSS, Java, 
						Java Sprint, Git and InVision. Everyone has made some contributions to GIT. 
					</p>

					<h2>Yi Yang</h2>
					<p>
						The workload of assignment three is much larger than assignment two, and the difficulty is also higher. 
						<br>
						<br>
						The part worthy of recognition is that most of the team members actively participate in the weekly tutorials and respond in a timely manner in our usual communication. But the part that needs to be improved is that some team members need to be urged multiple times to complete the task, and the quality of the completion is not up to expectations. It requires other team members to rework this part of the work, which means that the specific team member did less contribution on this assignment. One thing I have to mention is that the group has set the approximate schedule requirements for each meeting, but almost every time, the team member just finishes his tasks before the last minute. The other team members reminded him many times but he did not give a response, so we decided to deduct his contribution value. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Another aspect that certainly surprised me was that the prototype was completed in a timely and fast manner. Compared with textual work, the team members seem to prefer this kind of creative design work. During this assignment, I learned how to use invision to build a high fidelity prototype. I also learned that when communicating with each other, if the other party does not respond in time, I should make corresponding measures as soon as possible to stop the loss in time.

					<h2>Boan Cao</h2>
					<p>What I did well in this group learning activity was to complete the work assigned by the
						group carefully and to revise the deficiencies in a timely manner. I also have a sense of
						community and responsibility and enjoy working with others. However, I also realized my
						shortcomings during the group study. I did not take enough initiative myself and did not
						really put myself into it, but only completed the parts and tasks that I needed to complete.
						In future group activities, I will always remind myself to keep working hard and improving.
						This semester is the first semester of my university life, so I don't know much about the
						course and my classmates. I thought everyone was a fresher like me, but some of the group
						members in our group it was their last semester at university. This is what surprised me
						more, but at the same time I am grateful that they helped me a lot. During the group
						discussion, they pointed out my shortcomings and what could be improved. I also actively
						worked with them to revise what I had written, which taught me a lot and made me improve a
						lot. Through this group activity I also realized the importance of teamwork. When I work
						alone, I am not aware of my own shortcomings and problems. But in a group, we discuss and
						help each other, and we can get to know ourselves better so that we can improve faster. </p>

					<h2>Sixue Chen</h2>
					<p>In assignment1, I don’t know how to use css to beautify webpages. As a result, I only use
						basic html to make webpages in assignment1. This leads to my webpages not being very
						beautiful. In assignment2, I just learn from scratch About how to use css to beautify web
						pages, this is an improvement. And the team members pointed out some mistakes I made in the
						industry data very enthusiastically, for example, the data was not clear enough. I also
						modified this, and I am grateful to my team members, each of them is great. Our team has a
						clear division of labor at the beginning, and made a detailed plan about what each person
						needs to do, and everyone has provided good suggestions for the homework. cause the team
						members made a good time plan, this made us not drag the homework to the death line in the
						end, ha ha. </p>
					<p>My ability is lacking. At the beginning, I didn’t know how to clone some databases to modify
						it locally, and use some software. Under the guidance of the team members, I learned a lot.
						Regarding the imperfections, I think that some group members, including me, do not
						participate in group discussions frequently. I think it would be better if the group
						discussions become brainstorming. As for what surprised me, the production of the webpage
						was very professional, using professional terms such as JavaScript and css, and the beauty
						of the webpage surprised me.
					</p>

					<h2>Yingjian Di</h2>
					<p>In my opinion, all things, such as
						document writing, report writing and web page making, are very good. What we can
						strengthen is to make our project more detailed and accurately describe what to do at
						each step, because some parts of our project are imagined and not specifically tried, At
						the same time, the production of web pages surprised me because the web pages are simple
						and beautiful. At the same time, in this group work, I learned how to use CSS to
						beautify the web pages. I also learned to use GitHub to help the group complete the web
						pages. It is very useful because GitHub can help us share the same code for editing and
						will not interfere with each other.</p>

					<h2>Heran Wang</h2>
					<p>We were very active at the beginning of this assignment. Everyone is doing the assigned 
						work and the whole homework is really good at the beginning. During the first two weeks 
						of the operation, everyone can attend the meeting on time and report on their progress. 
						The progress of the project seems smooth. 
					</p>
					<p>
						But there will be some situations in the next few weeks, the most serious of which is 
						timely communication. Everyone will have all kinds of things to delay the process of 
						meetings. Although the whole project does not seriously affect the progress of the project, 
						it does affect the progress of others. Because only when everyone completes his or her task 
						can the rest of the team carry out the next task. Therefore, timely communication and timely 
						allocation of tasks is really important. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To my surprised, everyone is actively learning prototype design, learning the invision 
						software. Designing prototype is really interesting to me. I like to use the invision 
						software to design our project. Also, the moke up we do looks like a real website project. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Through this assignment, I really gained a lot. I learned how to design prototype and 
						how to use the invision software. I should write the report as soon as possible which 
						is the thing I need to improve. Communication is really important in the team work. We 
						need to exchange our mind and especially the new idea. 
					</p>

					<h2>Zhihao Liang</h2>
					<p>As a part of a team, I found that everything becomes ordered and simple when there is a good team
						leader Yingjian. We share our progress day by day so that my team member can review other
						people's content or HTML code. I think our project will do better if we can plan our tasks
						earlier and finish them rather than submitting the job at the last time. I was very surprised at
						our team leader Yingjian. He is very responsible. He planned each meeting and decided what we
						need to do. Without Yingjian, we would have big trouble managing our meetings and d distributing
						tasks. In this assignment, I learned how to arrange my timetable reasonably and HTML knowledge.
						I have to arrange my time properly because I still have other courses’ tasks. Reasonable
						work-life balance is the most valuable thing I learned this time. Using HTML to develop a static
						website is an amazing experience. I need to know many kinds of HTML elements to organize our
						website including body, head and so on. I am very lucky to be a part of the group, and I have
						learned a lot of IT skills and general skills.
