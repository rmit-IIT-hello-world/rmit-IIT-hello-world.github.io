					<p>My name is Yi Yang. My student number is s3798354 and my email address is s3798354@student.rmit.edu.au. I am from China. I currently study Information Technology in Australia. My favourite thing to do in my free time is to play with my cat. She is a British shorthair cat and the colour is blue and white. My major was mathematics when I entered university, but at that time I didn’t have much passion in mathematics. I subconsciously think that the process of learning mathematics may be very boring. At the same time, I saw that the university has a project in cooperation with RMIT, so I started to learn computer science then major in Information technology in RMIT. At the beginning, what attracted me was its creativity. With the development of industry, people's lives are increasingly inseparable from mobile phones. China’s software industry is also developing rapidly. Shopping software and social software are flooding people’s lives. At first, I felt that if I could participate in the development of a certain software, the things I created could be used by others in their daily lives. It will be a proud thing. Later, with the deepening of learning, I gradually felt that what attracted me to IT was the process of problem solving, exploration and research.  </p>

					<h2>personal test result</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="/images/yy-result.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>The results of tests indicate that I was INTJ-A which is also called the architect group. I stand for Introverted, N for Intuition, T for Thinking, J for Judgment and A for Assertive. Being introverted means I prefer solitary activities and get exhausted by social interaction. I tend to be quite sensitive to external stimulation in general. Being intuitive means I am very imaginative, open-minded and curious and I prefer novelty over stability and focus on hidden meanings and future possibilities. Thinking individuals focus on objectivity and rationality, prioritizing logic over emotions. I tend to hide their feelings and see efficiency as more important than cooperation. Judging individuals are decisive, thorough and highly organized. I value clarity, predictability and closure, preferring structure and planning to spontaneity. Assertive individuals are self-assured, even-tempered and resistant to stress. Generally, I refuse to worry too much and do not push myself too hard when it comes to achieving goals. My learning type is visual which means that I learn better when I read or see pictures. The results of these tests helped me understand myself more. When forming a group, I know that I would do a good job helping lead and manage the group. Using charts and graphs will also help me improve my ability to learn and achieve the team's goals. Overall, the results of my exams combined indicate that I have great skills working alone but I am good at leading others and managing the team as well as planning the future goals and aims of the group using pictures and visual material. I also have a good judgment in different situations and I am able to handle the case appropriately.</p>
