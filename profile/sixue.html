					<p>My name is Sixue Chen, my student ID is s3848461, my email is s3848461@student.rmit.edu.au, my nationality is Chinese, and the highest education I have received so far is grade12. I like to speak English But I speak Chinese more in daily life. I like sports such as running and rock climbing. Running is my favorite aerobic exercise. I can run for 1 hour continuously. I enjoy this process very much. I like playing games, such as League of Legends and so on. My interest in it is when I was in high school, I was very interested in online games, but the computer is slow, I found that my computer graphics card is AMD integrated graphics, so I try to learn some knowledge about computer accessories, and then I know what accessories can make the computer run smoothly, and some IT-related knowledge makes me become interested in IT. I am very interested in design because I don't know how to make a game. Because rmit’s campus design is very artistic, and here is the center of Melbourne, you can feel the charm of different cultures. And rmit has a high academic ranking in IT, I hope to come here to study, and the RMIT classroom has an academic atmosphere and a sense of design. I hope to learn more about the operation of HTMl and CSS, as well as some programming languages in my future studies. </p>

					<h2>personal test result</h2>
					<p>Stubborn or meticulous way of thinking may cause me not to deliberately pursue new ideas or focus on creative thinking. If a team member puts forward a creative idea but ignores certain objective factors, it may be difficult for me to accept the team member's point of view. Second, I don’t accept emotional expressions or consider the feelings of the same group of members. If this emotionality affects the progress of the entire team, the inconsistency of such emotions or opinions will lead to inefficiency. Based on the logistician's strong sense of responsibility, he may help the team members or accept some extra work, but this sense of responsibility will become a burden or lead to the failure to achieve the expected results. These factors will affect the team. </p>
