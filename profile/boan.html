					<h2>Personal profile</h2>

					<p>Hello, my name is Boan Cao and my student number is s3811618. I am 19 years old. I am currently
						studying at IT BP162 as an international student and this is the first semester for my
						university study. I was born and grew up in Beijing, China, which is a very beautiful and modern
						city. My native language is Mandarin, I can also speak English and a little bit of Japanese as
						well. I like playing basketball and games (Especially League of Legends). I also love watching
						anime. 
					</p>	
					<p>At a time when the Internet and computers were not as popular as they are today. My
						father took me into the field of the internet and computers when I was young, therefore I became
						interested in computers at that time. This is the reason that I chose to study IT for my first
						degree. To this day, programming is still something that interests me the most because in my
						view it can achieve any goal. Nowadays, people cannot live without the internet and IT. I
						believe it will become more and more important in the future. As this is my first semester at
						university, I don't have a lot of experience with IT. I am currently studying databases and
						python. I'm new to programming and my first programming was hello world, so I agree that the
						name of our group is hello world. </p>

					<h2>Personal test result</h2>
					<p>
						The results of these tests gave me a clearer indication of personality and attitude or method
						for learning. It can give me a clearer picture of myself and my strengths and weaknesses. I am a
						visual learner and I am good at learning by reading or looking at pictures. Understanding and
						remembering things through visuals. I can visualize in my mind what I am learning and learn best
						by using mainly visual methods. I often close my eyes to imagine or remember things or find
						something to look at if I feel bored. In terms of teamwork, I probably prefer to be organized
						and would like someone else to lead the team. At the same time, I have to communicate more to
						face others, and I hope to improve and complement with others.
