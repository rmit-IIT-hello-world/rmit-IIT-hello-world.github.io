					<h2>Personal profile</h2>

					<p>My name is Yingjian Di. My nickname is
						NormanD. My email is s3798345@student.rmit.edu.au. I come from northern China,welcome you to come here with me.
					</p>
					<p> Before I came to the Royal Melbourne Polytechnic Institute for my bachelor's degree, due to school reasons,
						I studied computer basics in a Chinese University for two years.
						I was very interested in the Internet and often explored all kinds of computer-related knowledge on my own. 
						That's why I chose this course and started using information technology after I went to CollegeBefore coming here, 
						I've learned some programming languages like HTML, Java, C and python, but it may take some time for me to become familiar with them.
						I want to learn more about RMIT. I usually play computer games and exercise at regular times a week. I always go to the gym three times a week.
						I like to work with my classmates to complete a project.</p>

					<h2>Personal test result</h2>
					<p>For the different results and
						comparative analysis of each time, I can understand myself more accurately. I am an outgoing
						person. I am creative and can provide new ideas in group homework, but my shortcomings are
						also obvious. My interest in things lasts for a short time. Repeated and cumbersome work
						will make me lose interest quickly and lack patience with things, This is also something to
						pay attention to in future study.
