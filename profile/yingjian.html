					<h2>Personal profile</h2>

					<p>My name is Yingjian Di. My nickname is
						Norman. My email is s3798345@student.rmit.edu.au. I come from northern China, where the
						climate is more comfortable and drier than Melbourne.
					</p>
					<p>Before coming to RMIT to study for a
						bachelor's degree, I had studied in a Chinese University for two years due to school
						cooperation. When I was very young, I was full of interest in the Internet and won the place
						in the computer competition in junior middle school. This is why I studied the subject of
						information technology after I went to college. Before coming here, I have some knowledge of
						HTML, Java, C and python programming languages. I hope to come to RMIT to learn more. I
						usually play computer games and exercise at a fixed time every week. I always go to the gym
						three times a week and often travel around the world.</p>

					<h2>Personal test result</h2>
					<p>For the different results and
						comparative analysis of each time, I can understand myself more accurately. I am an outgoing
						person. I am creative and can provide new ideas in group homework, but my shortcomings are
						also obvious. My interest in things lasts for a short time. Repeated and cumbersome work
						will make me lose interest quickly and lack patience with things, This is also something to
						pay attention to in future study.
