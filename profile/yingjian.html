					<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US">My name is Yingjian Di. My nickname is Norman. My email is s3798345@student.rmit.edu.au. I come from northern China, where the climate is more comfortable and drier than Melbourne.</span> <br>
				    <span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US">Before coming to RMIT to study for a bachelor's degree, I had studied in a Chinese University for two years due to school cooperation. When I was very young, I was full of interest in the Internet and won the place in the computer competition in junior middle school. This is why I studied the subject of information technology after I went to college. Before coming here, I have some knowledge of HTML, Java, C and python programming languages. I hope to come to RMIT to learn more. I usually play computer games and exercise at a fixed time every week. I always go to the gym three times a week and often travel around the world.</span><span data-ccp-props="{'335551550':6,'335551620':6}"> </span></p>

					<h2>Personal test result</h2>
					<p><span data-contrast="auto" xml:lang="EN-US" lang="EN-US">For the different results and comparative analysis of each time, I can understand myself more accurately. I am an outgoing person. I am creative and can provide new ideas in group homework, but my shortcomings are also obvious. My interest in things lasts for a short time. Repeated and cumbersome work will make me lose interest quickly and lack patience with things, This is also something to pay attention to in future study.</span><span data-ccp-props="{'335551550':6,'335551620':6}"> </span></p>
