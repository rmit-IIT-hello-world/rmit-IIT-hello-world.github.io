					<p>My name is Wang Heran, from Changchun, China. 
						I am honored to introduce myself to you in this way.
						 My first language is Mandarin and my second 
						 language is English. My name heran is not easy to
						  pronounce in English phonetics. Many friends 
						  call me "/hi ræn/" and some students call me "/hə(r) æn/”. 
						  In fact, the real pronunciation tends to "/hə(r) 
						  ræn/”. My student number is s3807131 and my RMIT 
						  student e-mail is s3807131@student.rmit.edu.au. 
					</p>
					<p>I am a qualified Chinese. I grew up in a Chinese 
						family environment. Learning is an indispensable 
						part of my life. Since I was a child, my parents
						 have signed up for many extra-curricular remedial
						 classes. This phenomenon is very common in most 
						 ities in China. So learning is one of my interests.
						 Although it sounds interesting, this is the truth.
						  Many times, I can't have both study and play. 
						  Naturally, I should focus on learning. 
					</p>

					<h2>Personal test result</h2>
					<p>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test:
						 ENFP-A. The result shows that I am a real 
						 spirit free and outgoing person. I think 
						 this kind of personality is very helpful 
						 to my team. I can make you active in a 
						 team. The results of an online learning
						  style test: Visual learner. The result
						   shows that I may wish to find out more
						    about what I can do to maximize my 
							learning potential. Therefore, in 
							group discussions, I will constantly
							 challenge myself and take on more
							  responsibilities. The results of 
							  one online DISC Assessment test:
							   Dominance.Although “D” type people
							    are direct and straightforward, 
								they are not necessarily hasty. 
								Therefore when I'm in a team, 
								I tend to be very energetic.
