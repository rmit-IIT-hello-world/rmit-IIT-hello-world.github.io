					<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed why or why
						not?</h2>
					<h3>Boan Cao</h3>
					<p>My view of the ideal job has not changed. What appeals me to software programmer is that it is a
						continuous job. Firstly, it requires software programming and is has to be developed with a
						team. Then it needs to be improved and refined slowly through a period of time. This process is
						also very much my favorite. I stick to my ideal job and think my ideal job will be to succeed.
					</p>
					<h3>Yingjian Di</h3>
					<p>I haven't changed my ideal job, because making games is my interest. I think as a game engineer,
						I can also be competent for other programming work, because there is a connection between
						programming languages, and what I lack is practical experience. The IT skills I selected are
						basically at the top of the list, and the generic skills are also at the top of the list.
						Through the list, I know that I still need more generic skills. </p>
					<h3>Yi Yang</h3>
					<p>No, I don’t think of changing the ideal job after looking at the burning glass data because
						developing game is my goal and I do not want to give it up before trying. </p>
					<h3>Zhihao Liang</h3>
					<p>After seeing the data, it has not changed my opinion on what job I want because software
						developer actually is a good job in burning glass data. </p>
					<h3>Heran Wang</h3>
					<p>After checking the data in Burning Glass, it has not changed my opinion on what job I want
						because PM is a good job in burning glass data. </p>
					<h3>Sixue Chen</h3>
					<p>I think my ideal job may change over time because the plan cannot keep up with the change. I need
						to learn this basic knowledge and keep a passion for IT so that I can try different jobs. It's
						very helpful for finding a job that I really like.</p>
